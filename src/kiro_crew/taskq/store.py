"""The durable task store: one SQLite file, write-before-ack, atomic claims.

``$KIROCREW_HOME/tasks/tasks.db`` is the scheduling source of truth for every
accepted task. The entry point that accepts work gets an id back only after the
row is committed (:meth:`TaskStore.accept`); a write that fails raises
:class:`TaskStoreUnavailable` so the caller has nothing to acknowledge.
Dispatch takes a row with one ``UPDATE ... WHERE state IN (claimable)`` that
also stamps a lease and bumps the generation, so two dispatchers cannot both
own a row and a worker from an older generation cannot overwrite a newer one's
outcome. Every state write goes through the transition table in ``model``.

The store keeps no dispatch state in memory: the bounded dispatch window is the
CALLER's list (``TaskStore.window`` is the size it should be bounded to), and
:meth:`fetch_dispatchable` refills it from the rows on disk in FIFO order. The
one in-memory fact it does keep is an index, not a decision: the ids of the
rows that are accepted and not yet started (:meth:`is_unstarted`), written
through after every committed write that moves a row into or out of that set
and loaded at :meth:`open`, so an
event-loop caller can ask "is this id still pending?" without the SQLite read
the loop must never take.

WAL is the default journal. A data home on a network filesystem gets
``journal_mode=DELETE`` instead -- WAL relies on shared memory the NFS/SMB
locking model does not provide -- and the fact is recorded in
:attr:`TaskStore.warnings` for ``kirocrew doctor``; the store never refuses to
open over it.

#
# ``dev_mode_arms_strict=False`` for the reason ``knowledge/store.py`` gives:
# two classes of on-loop take are tracked here, and an un-offloaded READ is not
# one of them -- a read reached from a coroutine is a DEFECT, and the way to find
# one is :attr:`TaskStore.loop_thread_calls` under an armed pin, never this
# comment. Both tracked classes are ORDERING problems; a write whose RETURN VALUE
# is load-bearing is NOT one, because the value can be awaited (the drained
# spawn's defer is: ``admission.gate``'s ``_deferred`` parks a ``DeferPoint``
# with both answers and ``finish_parked_defer`` awaits ``store.run(store.defer)``
# for the boolean that picks between them):
#
# 1. The terminal write on an unwinding arm is synchronous BY DESIGN --
#    ``taskq.adapters.runner``'s ``waiting_dependency`` cancel and its
#    ``_end_row_on_cancel`` (``admit``'s ``CancelledError`` arm, for a row the
#    caller never received a handle for), ``taskrunner``'s and
#    ``workflows.agent_pool``'s ``CancelledError`` / ``BaseException`` arms --
#    because an ``await`` there can be interrupted before the write is submitted
#    and a dropped terminal write leaves the row active for the next boot's
#    reconciler (see ``Admitted.settle_async``).
# 2. ``subagent_manager.admission.taskq_cancel_queued``, reached from
#    ``_unqueue`` on the Stop-all path: the row has to be cancelled before a
#    drain can claim it AND out of the in-memory window before a stagger timer
#    can start it, and an await between those two is a race in either order.
#
# Those takes are on-loop and cannot simply be offloaded, so arming this from
# ``KIROCREW_DEV_MODE`` would raise on a cancel or a Stop-all -- a Stop all whose
# unqueue raises leaves that row waiting and fails the request before it reaps
# anything -- and the developer's rational response, unsetting that variable,
# silences every OTHER surface's guard too. Flip it back to True once both

        in the future: a row whose deferral has lapsed is eligible again and waits
        for whatever picks it, which is not a deferral.

        The time counted is the time the row was actually PARKED in its current
        wait: each ``deferred`` event after the row's last ``claimed`` or
        ``transition`` event (the closers the queued listing applies too,
        ``_defer_details`` in the admission bridge) parks it from its ``ts`` to
        its ``until``, cut short by the next deferral or by now. A gap between a
        lapsed deferral and the next one is NOT counted: the row was eligible
        then and waited for a slot to be re-checked in, not for memory. So a row
        that was held back once and then queued behind a full cap is measured by
        its parked time alone, while a row the host keeps short (re-checked every
        admit wait) accrues almost all of its wall-clock time. Every re-check
        appends one more event, so the clock is never restarted by one; a claim
        or a re-queue ends the wait and the next deferral starts a new one.

        actually is, so nothing is widened: each step is an edge
        ``check_transition`` accepts, and each carries *generation*, so a row
        another owner ended stays ended.
