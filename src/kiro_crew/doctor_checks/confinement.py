    path to those bytes inside every agent namespace. So the launcher refuses instead. The
    refusal is correct and its text already names the remedy — but it reaches the operator
    as a failed spawn plus a ``logger.warning`` in the gateway log, and the shapes that
    trigger it are ORDINARY operation for something else on the host: ``cp -al``,
    rsnapshot and other hard-link snapshot tools raise link counts on config files, and a
    dotfile manager may keep the pointer as a link into its own tree. Nobody did anything
    wrong, and the first symptom is that every agent stops starting. This is the place an
    operator looks for that.

    Linux only. The refusal is on the namespace launcher's path; a macOS Seatbelt profile
    denies by path rule and never needs a mount target, so naming it there would report a
    spawn outage that will not happen.

    The sentence is the launcher's own (``sandbox.live_target_pointer_unfitness``), not a
    paraphrase, so an operator who sees this line and later hits the refusal reads one
    diagnosis rather than two.
