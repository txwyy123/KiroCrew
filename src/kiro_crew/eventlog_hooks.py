    field at all (no member/config has ever been appended) — appends one
    MEMBER_CONFIG carrying the full config snapshot plus a ``changed`` list, so
    the log becomes correct even when the config was edited by hand rather than
    through the dashboard (which emits its own member/config on save).

    Returns the ``changed`` field list when an event was appended, ``None`` when
    the roster already matched (no write). Best-effort: any failure is swallowed
    and reported as ``None``.

    Two different staleness windows sit between the caller's decision and this
    write, and each has its own guard.

    *config_stamp* closes the first, and is REQUIRED: it is the digest
    ``load_config_with_content_stamp`` bound to the bytes ``agent_cfg`` was parsed
    from. The caller's ``agent_cfg`` comes from a config it loaded earlier, and a save
    landing after that load writes config.json AND appends its own member/config -- so
    the roster view can already carry the NEW values while ``agent_cfg`` still carries
    the old ones, and the comparison above then reads the save as drift and appends the
    pre-save snapshot over it. The projection is what the roster row and the
    member_projection frame render, and the log has no compaction, so that regression
    stands until something re-reads. Passing the stamp makes this refuse unless the
    live config is still those bytes. A caller whose load could not name them holds no
    stamp to pass and must not reconcile at all, which is why the parameter admits no
    stand-in for "unknown" and why this is the only entry: an exemption reachable by
    passing a falsy value is one a caller that merely FAILED to name its bytes reaches
    by accident, which is exactly the regression above.

    The conditional append closes the second: another writer can commit between
    the comparison and this write. ``append_closer_if_still_applies`` re-asks
    ``_config_is_still_at`` against the current projection under the lock that
    writes, and the store admits the entry only while the log's tail is still where
    the fold that answered it reached. A refusal is a normal outcome -- the other

    that, and both matter because this log is the projections' only input.

    The answer is RETURNED, so a caller whose own record is this event alone can
    tell a landed transition from an omitted one instead of assuming. Callers that
    already persist through an authoritative store first do not need it: the two
    boundary writers fence their change and answer 500 when the fence itself
    fails, so their event is a second copy rather than the record.

    A failure is REPORTED rather than logged at debug. What is lost is a
    transition that will not be retried, and at debug an omitted transition is
    indistinguishable from one that never happened -- which is the single
    distinction a projection built from this log exists to make.
