"""Agent template management: the roster the Agent templates tab reads and writes.

A template is the harness-level agent definition (``~/.kiro/agents/<name>.json``)
a chat or a crewmate runs. The crew editor's Template pane edits a crew's
PRIVATE copy of one (blueprint semantics, see ``api_agent_fork``); this module is
the other half -- managing the shared templates themselves:

* ``GET /api/agents/templates`` -- every installed global template with the two
  things a management page needs beside the spec's own fields: whether it can be
  edited here (``read_only`` names why not), and what still points at it
  (``used_by``: crews, the default agent, schedules, chat folders, webhooks,
  private copies).
* ``POST /api/agents/templates`` -- create a template, blank or as a copy of an
  installed one. Nothing is enrolled as a crewmate.
* ``DELETE /api/agents/detail/{name}`` -- delete a template the user owns, refused
  while anything still references it (``409 template_referenced`` lists what).

What is NOT editable here, and why each is a rule rather than a gap:

* a **package** template (``<Package>-<name>.json``): the package rewrites the
  file on its next install, so an edit would be silently reverted -- duplicate
  it to own a copy;
* a **runtime** template (``kirocrew*.json`` in ``OWNED_KIRO_AGENT_FILES``): the
  runtime refreshes these; the same reversal applies;
* a **markdown** spec: one hand-authored document that a JSON round-trip would
  lose fields from (the detail PATCH already refuses it);
* a **private copy** (``private_to`` set): it belongs to one crew and is edited
  from that crew's Template pane, where reset/publish keep its lineage straight.

What the reference guard counts, and the one holder it deliberately does not:

* it counts every CONFIGURATION that names a template -- a crew binding, the
  default agent, a schedule's ``agent_id``, a chat folder's ``default_agent``, a
  webhook token's ``agent``, a private copy's ``forked_from`` -- because each
  silently redirects FUTURE work (a new session, the next cron fire, the next
  webhook call) onto whatever the missing name falls back to;
* it does NOT count an open chat slot that picked the template (``agent_kind:
  "template"``). A slot is a conversation the user has on screen, not a
  configuration that outlives it: its header names the template, and a delete
  guard that passed or refused depending on which tabs happen to be open in
  which window would be one nobody could reason about from the roster. The
  slot's next session start degrades the way any slot naming an unknown agent
  does (kiro-cli falls back to the default spec), visibly, in that chat.

    private-copy spec, and with ``409 template_referenced`` (carrying the list)
    while a crew, the default agent, a schedule, a chat folder, a webhook or a
    private copy still names it: deleting underneath them would leave sessions
    that cannot start, or that silently start on the default agent.

    The reference check and the unlink are ONE critical section, off the loop,
    under every lock the reference stores' writers take -- the shape
    ``_unlink_copy_unless_referenced`` in ``dashboard/agent_admin/template_lineage.py`` established:

    * the folder store lock (``state.hold_folders``), held across the whole
      section, so no folder pin can commit between the check and the unlink;
    * the ``config.json`` advisory lock and, nested, the ``config.local.json``
      overlay's own lock (``update_config_locked`` on each, writing nothing) --
      cross-process, so a CLI ``config set`` or another gateway is excluded,
      not just this loop's handlers; crew bindings, the default agent and the
      fork sidecar (whose writers run inside the same config hold) are read
      under them;
    * the spec lock around the unlink itself;
    * innermost, the schedule store's own cross-process lock
      (``cron.cron_store_lock``, the one the scheduler's mutators take), held
      from the dispatch-reference walk through the rename.

    Webhook tokens are read inside that section AND their writers commit under
    the same spec lock (``hooks._commit_pinned_token`` re-verifies the agent
    there), so a pin cannot land against a file this delete is removing.
    Schedules are pinned by the store lock, so one cannot be saved against the
    template between the walk and the rename; the post-rename re-read below is
    for a writer that bypasses that lock (a hand edit). A present-but-unreadable
    ``crons.json`` fails the delete CLOSED (``503 schedule_store_unreadable``);
    a store lock another holder keeps past the bounded wait is
    ``503 schedule_store_busy``, nothing unlinked.
