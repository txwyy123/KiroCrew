    """Write every byte of ``data`` to ``fd``, tolerating short writes.

    ``os.write`` on a blocking PTY controller fd may accept fewer bytes than requested
    when the tty input buffer is full: it blocks until *some* space frees, writes
    what fits, and returns a short count. A single ``os.write`` that discards its
    return therefore silently truncates a large paste under a backpressured
    reader. Loop over a ``memoryview`` so partial writes advance without
    reslicing, until the buffer is fully consumed.

    The loop writes through a private ``os.dup`` of ``fd``, taken before the
    first write. A concurrent ``_kill_session`` closes the session's descriptor
    without waiting for in-flight writes, and the kernel may hand that NUMBER
    to an unrelated ``open()`` — a loop still holding the raw number would then
    write the paste's remaining bytes into whatever reused it. The dup pins the
    PTY's file description for the loop's lifetime, so the original can close
    and be reused freely; once the shell side is gone, writes to the dup raise
    (``EIO``) instead of landing elsewhere. The race window shrinks back to the
    single ``dup`` call, no wider than the single-``os.write`` shape this
    replaced. Teardown still never waits on writers — semantics unchanged.

    Runs inside a single executor call so a multi-KB write does not bounce
    per-chunk through the event loop. ``OSError`` (a closed fd at the ``dup``,
    or the PTY torn down mid-loop) propagates to the caller unchanged.

    in which case the spawn itself is compromised first and a fence tag adds
    nothing. Probing the directory rather than resolving and filtering also means
    an unrelated ``PATH`` entry earlier in the search order (a venv, an asdf shim)
    cannot shadow a co-located shell out of the map.

    COVERAGE, deliberately narrow: a shell is offered only when it is co-located
    with the session's own shell AND neither it nor any ancestor of that directory
    is OWNED by the gateway's user (an owner can chmod at will, so mode bits alone
    prove nothing). Nothing this process could rewrite is ever offered, which is
    what closes the swap-after-discovery window: a path is reported now and invoked
    later, when the user confirms. That leaves the ordinary distro layout
    (root-owned ``/usr/bin``) and excludes a user-owned prefix -- Homebrew's, a
    workspace, a project-local ``bin`` -- where the snippet then behaves exactly as
    it does today. Under a root gateway every path is owned by the caller, so
    nothing is offered at all; that is the safe direction.

    Blocking note: a bounded handful of stats, run in the same off-loop hop as
    ``_resolve_shell`` rather than inline.

    Python 3.13 venv import Kiro Crew's 3.12 site-packages and its C extensions

    """Environment that makes a real login Bash report readiness at its prompt.

    Bash reads an ``--init-file`` only when it is *not* a login shell, so the
    marker cannot ride an injected rc file without giving up ``-l`` — and giving
    up ``-l`` breaks the profile chain: ``shopt -q login_shell`` is then false, so
    every profile stanza guarded on login-ness silently no-ops and the user's
    environment never loads. Sourcing the same files from an rc file cannot
    substitute, because that option is read-only and stays off.

    A login shell does honour a ``PROMPT_COMMAND`` inherited from its
    environment, and runs it after the profile chain returns and before the first
    prompt — exactly where the readiness marker has to fire.

    The snippet is single-shot and self-removing: it emits only while the token
    variable is still set, unsets that token so neither a later prompt nor a
    child shell repeats the sequence, and withdraws itself from
    ``PROMPT_COMMAND`` only when that variable is still exactly the scalar that
    was exported. Both halves of that last test matter: a profile that APPENDED
    (``PROMPT_COMMAND="$PROMPT_COMMAND; history -a"``) no longer matches, and one
    that appended as an ARRAY (``PROMPT_COMMAND+=("history -a")``, Bash 5.1+)
    leaves the exported text as element zero — which the scalar expansion alone
    would match, so unsetting there would take the user's own element with it.
    ``${PROMPT_COMMAND[1]+x}`` distinguishes the two without Bash 5.1 syntax the
    ``/bin/bash`` on macOS (3.2) cannot parse.

    A profile that ASSIGNS ``PROMPT_COMMAND`` outright drops the hook, and with
    it the marker: that session's barrier never opens, and the client's own
    bounded timeout reports the failure without writing. That is the same
    fail-closed outcome the barrier already has for a profile that never returns,
    and it is deliberate — releasing on inferred progress instead risks handing a
    queued command to a profile that is still reading input, which corrupts it.

    One case is NOT fail-closed and is worth naming: a profile that installs its
    own hook only when the variable looks unset — ``[ -z "$PROMPT_COMMAND" ] &&
    PROMPT_COMMAND=…``, which is how the RHEL-family ``/etc/bashrc`` installs its
    terminal-title updater — sees the exported hook, skips its own install, and
    then this snippet withdraws itself, so that session ends with no prompt
    command at all. It cannot be fixed by choosing a better moment or a cleverer
    guard: every carrier a login shell inherits is visible to the profile chain,
    and the carriers that are invisible to it (``BASH_ENV``, non-interactive only;
    ``ENV``, POSIX mode only; ``INPUTRC``, cannot run commands) do not run at the
    post-profile point a readiness marker needs.
    An operator who EXPORTED ``PROMPT_COMMAND`` into the gateway's own
    environment keeps it: the exported value is the readiness hook followed by
    the inherited command, and the withdrawal restores the inherited command
    rather than unsetting the variable. Replacing it outright would be data loss,
    not just a lost nicety — ``PROMPT_COMMAND='history -a'`` is the standard way
    to make concurrent shells append to ``HISTFILE``, and without it a shell
    exiting OVERWRITES that file with its own in-memory list, dropping the
    commands every sibling shell had appended.

    Two mutually exclusive tiers, chosen by the CLIENT because only the client can
    see the screen row:

    * **path** (no ``argv`` in the body) — the default tier. Body
      ``{session_id, token, folders_only?}`` where ``token`` is the DEQUOTED
      literal path the cursor sits in (``"../Kiro"``, ``"src/"``, ``""``); the
      client decodes backslash escapes before asking, so an on-screen ``my\\ dir/``
      arrives here as ``my dir/``.
    * **command** (``argv`` present) — subcommands and flags for an allowlisted
      CLI, e.g. ``argv: ["gh", "pr"]`` with ``token: "cre"``. See
      ``dashboard/terminal_commands.py`` for the protocols and the authority
      argument.

    The tiers do not fall back into one another. The client sends ``argv`` only for
    a word that cannot be a path (no separator, not ``~``-rooted) under a command
    that is not a known path command, so the two never both apply — and keeping
    them disjoint means the path tier's response shape is untouched by this
    addition.

    Authority note (path tier): this lists a directory on behalf of an
    authenticated caller who already owns a LIVE PTY in this gateway — i.e. an
    interactive shell with the gateway user's full filesystem access. Requiring an
    existing session id is what keeps it from being a general filesystem-
    enumeration endpoint; it grants nothing the session's own `ls` does not. Paths
    are therefore resolved without a root restriction, exactly like the shell
    would — with one carve-out: the governance trust-root and credential dirs
    (``is_sensitive_path``) are never enumerated, and no individual ENTRY inside an
    allowed directory is returned if it (or its symlink target) is itself
    protected, so the panel cannot be used to harvest protected metadata names."""
