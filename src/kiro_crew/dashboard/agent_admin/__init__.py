"""Private owners composed by :mod:`kiro_crew.dashboard.handlers.agents`.

The dashboard agent-administration HTTP handlers are split by responsibility across
the modules of this package, and ``kiro_crew.dashboard.handlers.agents`` stays their
only import path and their only patch surface: nothing but the handlers module
imports an owner.

Each owner holds handlers and helpers moved verbatim from the one-module file.
:func:`compose` makes every function an owner defines -- its module functions and
the methods of the classes it defines -- run on the handlers module's globals rather
than its own. Tests patch the handlers' names (``agents._require_owner``,
``._sel``, ``.list_agents``, ``.update_config_locked``, ``._rebind_crew_locked``,
``._AVATAR_MAX_BYTES`` and dozens more). A function that read its owner's globals
would keep calling the unpatched object and the test would pass while exercising
nothing, so the handlers stay ONE namespace, as the one-module file was. Three
consequences follow:

* An owner's imports are inert for its functions. An owner imports the handlers
  module only under ``TYPE_CHECKING``, and stdlib and third-party names (such as
  ``aiohttp.web``) plainly; both serve the type checker and the linter. Every name a
  function reads must exist in ``kiro_crew.dashboard.handlers.agents`` -- which is
  why that module keeps imports only its owners read, marked ``# noqa: F401`` --
  and ``test_dashboard_agents_composition_contract.py`` sweeps each function's
  bytecode to prove it does.
* A function's ``__module__`` reads ``kiro_crew.dashboard.handlers.agents`` as it
  did before the split, so reprs, pickling by reference and the owner-gate test's
  route walk (which selects handlers by ``__module__``) are unchanged, and it logs
  through that module's ``logger``. Its source file differs, so a log record's
  ``module``, ``filename`` and ``lineno`` name the owner file. An owner's classes
  keep their own module, which is where ``inspect`` looks for a class's source.
* State stays on the handlers module. Every module-level value (the config lock,
  the ``--list-models`` catalog cache, the capability-package bounds, the avatar
  size cap and type tables, ``logger``) is a handlers global that owner functions
  reach by name, so a test that rebinds it there is the binding every function
  sees. No owner defines a module-level value.

:func:`compose` is the technique ``kiro_crew.dashboard.messaging_api.compose`` and
``kiro_crew.dashboard.file_api.compose`` apply to the messaging and file handlers.
This package keeps its own copy because nothing but ``handlers/agents.py`` may
import an ``agent_admin`` module.

Which responsibility each owner holds, and which constructs stay in the handlers
module because repository guards read them there, is recorded in
``docs/system-specs/modules/learn-cron-dashboard.md`` (the "Dashboard agent
administration owners" paragraph under Key Endpoints).

    """Run every function *owners* define on *namespace*.

    *namespace* is the handlers module's ``globals()``. The handlers module calls
    this once, after its own body has bound every name, so a single pass replaces
    every binding of an owner function -- in the handlers module, in the owners and
    in the owners' classes -- with its rebound copy, and no module is left holding
    the original.

    A function is an owner's when its code was compiled from that owner's file,
    whatever globals it carries: a handlers module imported a second time into the
    same process rebinds the owners onto its fresh namespace. The owners are
    imported once per process, so their classes are shared by every handlers import
    and their methods follow the most recent one.
