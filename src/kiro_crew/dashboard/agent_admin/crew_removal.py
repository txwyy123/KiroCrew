    """Whether any crew in the config ON DISK NOW still derives *slug*.

    The authorization for removing a member's crew log, and the whole of it: not
    an age, not a size, not a threshold anyone can tune. A member's unit is keyed
    by its slug, so the only question that makes a removal safe is whether a live
    member still answers to that key.

    Resolved through ``member_slug``, never ``slug_for_name``, and enumerated
    without a name-grammar filter -- both for the reasons
    ``members._slug_is_claimed_by_any_member`` documents for the same question.
    The two spellings disagree for a crew whose persisted ``member_id`` is not
    what its name derives, which provisioning produces deliberately, and the
    create route validates a crew name only for credential shape, so a name the
    roster grammar rejects can still be a live crew. Either mistake reports a
    live owner as gone, and the caller reads "gone" as licence to delete that
    owner's history.

    Fails CLOSED, and the loader is why this needs saying: a ``config.json`` that
    does not parse is not an exception here -- it is logged, marked degraded, and
    the load returns DEFAULTS, so the roster reads empty and an emptiness test
    alone would take that as proof the owner is gone. So an absent owner counts
    only when the file it is absent from was actually read: the whole-config
    degradation marker answers claimed, as does a load that raises, and a crew
    whose own identity will not resolve is skipped rather than allowed to decide.
    Nothing is removed on an error, because the cost of keeping a deleted
    member's log is disk and the cost of the other answer is a live member's
    history.

    One residue, stated rather than guessed at: the loader also normalizes an
    ``agents`` value that is not an object at all to an empty roster without
    marking the file degraded, which this cannot tell from a roster that is
    genuinely empty. It costs at most the ONE slug a caller is deciding -- the
    member whose record the delete already committed -- because the predicate
    answers about that slug alone and never about the tree.

    The crew log is the last thing a deleted member leaves behind. Its config
    record, its memory store, its avatar and its private template copy all go
    with the delete; without this the log stays on disk for the life of the
    installation, with no member to read it for and no other path that collects
    it -- the retention sweep ages SESSION logs from their close entry, and a
    member log has no close to age from.

    *cfg* is the config the caller captured while it still held *name*'s record,
    and the slug is resolved from it: a member carrying an explicit ``member_id``
    keys its log by that id, so resolving the slug once the record is gone would
    fold the name instead and aim at a different unit.

    Call this while holding ``memory_store_namespace_lock``. The guard it hands
    the store re-reads the roster, which on its own makes the decision a snapshot:
    a member id allocated in another process derives the same slug and addresses
    the same unit, and the unlink has no recovery path. That lock is the one seam
    every allocator of a member id shares, so holding it is what keeps the window
    between the decision and the unlink shut.

    Best-effort, like every other step of this teardown. The record is already
    gone by the time this runs, so raising would turn a log that could not be
    collected into a failed delete against a crew that is absent. ``owned`` is
    the ordinary answer while a queued append still holds the lease, and
    ``absent`` the ordinary answer for a member that never wrote one.
