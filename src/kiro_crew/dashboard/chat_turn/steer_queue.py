    Authorization is decided when a prompt is ADMITTED (`authorize_target` for
    `session_send`, the authenticated composer for a human typing into a busy
    session), but delivery happens later, at this drain — and the target-side
    containment those decisions rest on can change in between: a target
    authorized while unlinked can be given a channel or mirror link before its
    queue drains, and the queued prompt would then execute and republish to an
    audience its admission never contemplated.

    Producers of plain (user-speech) entries stamp the containment snapshot at
    enqueue (`session_control.containment_meta`); this sweep recomputes the same
    constraints and drops any entry for which a constraint holds NOW that did
    not hold at admission — including a WORKSPACE change, which swaps the
    memory/lessons/project context under a waiting prompt. An unmarked plain
    entry fails closed against the boolean constraint set, so an untagged
    producer can never ride a queued prompt past a boundary the tagged paths
    respect.

    Entries carrying `_directive_user_origin` (authenticated-human provenance)
    are exempt from the LINKED constraint only: the author typed into the
    session's own surface and linking it is that owner's deliberate act, so
    composer input into a just-linked session is designed behaviour. A NEW
    outbound mirror still drops them — the author does not control mirror
    links — as do all other constraints (see
    `session_control.newly_held_constraints`).

    Structural exemption is narrow: cron notifications and sub-agent
    completions only (`CRON_NOTIFICATION_KIND` / `SUBAGENT_COMPLETION_KIND`) —
    runner machinery minted fresh by trusted internal producers, which
    channel-born sessions receive by design. Synthetic-recovery entries are
    NOT exempt: a recovery replays externally admitted content verbatim, so it
    is re-validated like any plain entry against the admission stamp its
    requeue recorded (`_queue_recovery`), failing closed when unmarked.

    Runs at the top of the drain with no suspension point between the snapshot
    and the dequeue (everything below is synchronous on the event loop), so the
    decision cannot go stale before the surviving entry becomes a turn. A drop
    is never silent: the queue card is retracted, a visible notice naming the
    changed constraint lands in the transcript, and the drop is written to the
    SEL.

    A CROSS-SESSION delivery is reported in both directions. The entry carries
    the sending session as a slot key plus that slot's tab identity
    (`session_control.send_origin_meta`, stamped at admission beside the
    containment snapshot), so the sender gets its own notice naming
    the target and the changed constraint
    (`session_control.notify_send_origin_dropped`) and the SEL row names it as
    the drop's origin. Without that the sender's last word on the message is the
    `started: False` receipt it got when the target queued it, and the outcome it
    most needs — the message will never run — would reach only the target's
    transcript. A human-typed entry carries no stamp and is unaffected.
