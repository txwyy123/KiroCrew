"""The queued depth each parent last published, read back by the slot list.

The ``subagent_queued`` event is the dashboard's fast signal for "N waiting to
start", and nothing re-sends a frame a client missed: a socket that dropped one,
or a reducer that never applied it, keeps the count it last saw until a
reconnect. The slot list therefore carries the depth the manager last
PUBLISHED for each slot (``subagents_queued`` beside ``subagents_running``,
routed to the tab the frames went to), so every slots push reconciles a client
to the frame stream, including a client that is not showing that session.

It is the published value, never a new read: ``serialize_slots`` runs on the
event loop for every tab, and the store half of the depth is a task-store
count. Every publish already goes through ``_fire_event``, so recording there
keeps the slot list and the frame stream on one value by construction.

A held entry is re-derived from state: every child start or end for a parent
with a non-zero entry re-reads the count (``_fire_event``) and publishes it when
it differs from the entry, so a path that pops or ends a row without emitting
cannot leave a count in the table for the slot list to keep re-sending, and a
path that did emit is not answered with a second, identical frame.

Bounded: a depth of 0 is not stored, a parent end forgets its entry
(``SubagentManager.cancel_for_teardown``), and past :data:`MAX_PUBLISHED_PARENTS`
the oldest entry goes. An evicted entry reads as 0 until that parent's next
frame, which re-records it.
