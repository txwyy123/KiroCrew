"""Admission behavior for the SubagentManager facade.

Admission is also where the durable task queue (``kiro_crew.taskq``) meets the
manager: a spawn is persisted BEFORE its id is returned, the in-memory
``_queue`` is only a bounded window over the store's queued rows, memory
pressure defers a row instead of refusing it, and every dispatch goes through
an atomic claim whose generation fences later writes. The ``taskq_*`` methods
are the whole of that glue; they are plain methods (not ``*_impl``), so they
run on their own module's globals and import ``taskq`` only on use.

The coordinator is one class assembled from one module per concern, each a
mixin over :class:`ManagerComponent` with no state of its own:

* :mod:`.types` -- the value types (settings, prepared row, claim and defer
  points, capacity reading) and the constants importers read.
* :mod:`.gate` -- ``spawn_impl``: every policy and capacity check between a
  request and its row, plus the typed refusal.
* :mod:`.pump` -- stagger, drain and the atomic claim -> dispatch -> register
  -> reservation-release unit (``taskq_claim``, ``claim_and_start``,
  ``release_reservation``, ``_drain_queue_sync_impl`` live together: the
  generation fence is one module, with no loop hop inside it).
* :mod:`.taskq_bridge` -- store open/accept/defer/settle, the bounded window
  and its refill, and the single owner of off-loop store writes
  (``_post_store_write`` / ``track_store_task``).
* :mod:`.fairness` -- lanes, the child reserve, the capacity view.
* :mod:`.waits` -- yielding the lane slot, resuming through admission, child
  registration and wait deadlines.

``kiro_crew.subagent_manager.admission`` stays the import path: every name an
importer or a test reads is re-exported here.

The ``*_impl`` methods are bound onto the manager's namespace by
``bind_component_globals``, which walks ``vars(SpawnAdmissionCoordinator)``
only -- an inherited method would be skipped and run on its mixin's globals,
where the manager's names do not exist. ``_hoist_impls`` therefore copies each
mixin's ``*_impl`` into this class's own ``__dict__`` at import time, so the
rebinding (and ``copy_component_docs``) sees them exactly as it did when the
class was one module.
