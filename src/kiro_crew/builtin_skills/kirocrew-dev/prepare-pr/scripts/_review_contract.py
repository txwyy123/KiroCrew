    """True when the WORKFLOW's own heading says adjudication downgraded this head.

    Read from the text BEFORE the first ``<details>``, which on a non-blocking
    body is entirely workflow-authored: the HTML key, the ``## <Lane> Review --
    <verdict>`` heading rendered from the parsed adjudication decision, and the
    sentence naming the head. The model's own output is embedded inside
    ``<details><summary>Review details</summary>`` on that path, so nothing it
    writes can reach this region -- which is the whole point, because the
    alternative signal (a ``[BLOCK-MERGE-DOWNGRADED]`` marker anywhere in the
    body) sits in the embedded model text and a review whose prose contains it
    would forge its own clearance.

    Requires the heading to BE a heading (``^##``) rather than the phrase
    appearing loose, and requires the head to be named in the same region, so a
    heading left over from another head does not clear this one.

    And it answers False for every lane outside ``DOWNGRADE_LANES``, which is what
    makes the region argument above TRUE rather than merely plausible. The
    whole-design lanes assemble their comment as marker, heading, one italic line
    naming the head, then the raw model summary -- with no ``<details>`` anywhere
    (``design-review.yml:661-668``, and the same shape in its two siblings). For
    them the "region above the first ``<details>``" is the entire body, model prose
    included, and the workflow prints the head sha into it too, so a single
    injected ``##`` heading would be the whole distance to a forged clearance. No
    lane but GPT's workflow renders the phrase, so no other lane loses anything.

    The region argument also holds only on GPT's CLEAR path, which is the one a
    genuine downgrade takes: it wraps the model's output in ``<details>``
    (``codex-review.yml:1382-1390``). A BLOCKING body takes the sibling branch and
    is emitted UNWRAPPED (``codex-review.yml:1378-1379``), so there ``prefix`` is
    the whole body, model prose included, and the workflow's own sentence has
    already put the head sha in it. What stays true on every body is positional:
    the workflow writes its heading FIRST, so the phrase appearing below a heading
    is text that arrived after one -- model prose. Requiring the match to BE the
    body's first ``##`` is therefore what makes the region argument hold on the
    blocking path too.

    Deliberately not also keyed on a live ``[BLOCK-MERGE] <head>``: it would reject
    strictly fewer bodies than the positional rule already does, because a sample
    that is blocking by DECLARATION carries no such marker at all.

    Returns ``{"ok", "lanes", "lanes_seen", "blocking_dropped", "error"}``.
    ``lanes`` carries one entry per bound lane whose history was read, each with
    the current body's shape and a newest-first list of superseded samples for
    this head. ``lanes_seen`` is how many lanes were actually examined, reported
    as its own field so a caller reads the population rather than inferring it
    from an array's length. ``blocking_dropped`` names the lanes where a
    superseded sample BLOCKED this head and the body now presented does not --
    the direction that turns a judged block into a clean board, which is the only
    direction that can manufacture a pass. A sample blocks in either of the two
    spellings the lanes use: ``[BLOCK-MERGE] <head>`` in the body, which GPT and
    Opus write, or a ``<Lane>-Verdict: BLOCK`` line from a whole-design lane,
    which never writes that marker at all. See ``_sample_shape``.

    A lane is NOT named when the presented body's WORKFLOW-AUTHORED heading says
    adjudication downgraded this head: that is the repository's own record that the
    block was cleared by decision, and the rewrite producing it necessarily leaves a
    superseded blocking body behind. ``current_downgraded`` reports that reading per
    lane. The heading is used rather than the rewritten marker because the marker
    lands inside the embedded model output -- see ``_sanctioned_downgrade``.

    A lane is also NOT named for a block that an accepted human-override record
    for this lane and this EXACT head post-dates: a repository writer adjudicated
    the lane at this commit after that block was on the board. This is the only
    same-head exit a FORK lane has. The same-repo override arm also replaces the
    slot with an unstamped note, which ends the reading through
    ``current_stamped``, but a Stage-2 fork lane writes no such note, so without
    the record its clean re-roll reads as a dropped block that nothing can clear.
    Records come from ``human_override_instants``: a trusted bot author, the
    marker as the leading bytes, the exact head, and this lane's target or
    ``all``. A block published in or after the second the newest such record
    was posted stays named: the writer cannot have judged it. (The record's time
    is when the handler posted it, a few seconds to minutes after the command; a
    block landing inside that window is the stated residual.) ``override_at``
    reports the record's time per lane.

    ``ok`` False means the question could not be ANSWERED and must be read as
    unknown, never as "nothing was superseded". Two causes reach it and both fail
    closed. An unreadable history is one. EXAMINING NO LANE AT ALL is the other:
    a head whose lanes have not posted yet, or whose only comment wearing a lane
    key fails the author check, yields an empty lane set, and answering "nothing
    was superseded" there reports calm from having observed nothing -- the same
    shape as a clean scan of an empty population. A gate that has never seen a
    lane has not verified stability. So zero examined is UNKNOWN, stated in
    ``error``, rather than a pass a caller has to know to distrust.

    A caller that gates on this treats False as pending, the same convention
    disposition_gate uses: a transient API failure must not turn a required
    status red.

        # block B, an adjudication clearing B, then a later clean leaves A
        # unadjudicated and unreported, and readiness permits the merge.
