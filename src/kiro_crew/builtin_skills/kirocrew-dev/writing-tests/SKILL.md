## Where this skill stops, and which sibling takes over

This skill owns **authoring** a test: isolation, determinism, cross-platform
behaviour, diagnosing a residue failure, and suite speed. Three siblings own the
neighbouring steps, and none of them restates what is here:

| You are doing | Skill |
|---|---|
| Writing, fixing, or speeding up a test | **this skill** |
| Running the build gate in a worktree, and deciding whether a red is yours | **kirocrew-worktree-dev** |
| Driving a branch to a review-ready PR and through CI | **prepare-pr** |
| Polling that PR until it is green | **babysit** |

The line that matters most in practice: **kirocrew-worktree-dev** tells you whether a
failure is yours (re-run it on `origin/main`, mine CI for what is genuinely flaky);
once it is yours, the fix is here. Do not fix a flake from a summary of the five
determinism classes — pick the class from the symptom, in Rule 2.

## The two properties, and why they are one problem

A test must be **hermetic** (no effect that outlives it, anywhere but its own tmp dir)
and **deterministic** (same verdict every run, on every platform, in any order). They
are the same problem because the suite runs `-n auto --dist loadgroup`: a side effect
is not just untidy, it is *the input to another test on the same worker*, and it
surfaces as a flake in a file you never touched.

## Rule 0 — Know which conftest is under your file BEFORE you isolate anything

`setup.cfg` declares two testpaths and they do **not** get the same fixtures. The
table is in [testing-conventions.md](../../../../../docs/system-specs/common/testing-conventions.md)
§ Which conftest you are standing on — read it rather than a second copy here, which
would drift. The short version: only `test/` gets `test/conftest.py`;
`src/kiro_crew/apps/builtins/*/tests/` gets the rootdir `conftest.py` plus that app's
own `tests/conftest.py` where one exists.

The rootdir `conftest.py` is the **host floor** — the guards that protect the
developer's machine, so they hold everywhere. That covers damage (temp dirs, the data
home, services) and *resource exhaustion*: the xdist worker budget is registered there,
from the repo-root `xdist_budget.py`, because a run that spawns one worker per core on a
small laptop takes the machine down and does not care which testpath asked. Everything
else is in `test/conftest.py`.

Getting this wrong is the most expensive mistake in this suite, because it fails
**silently and asymmetrically**: an in-package test that assumes `test/conftest.py`'s
fixtures passes on CI (where the operator's home is empty) and damages a real install
locally. When you add isolation, ask: *could a test in ANY testpath damage the host —
or consume enough memory, cores or disk to take it down — without this?* If yes it
belongs at the rootdir; if no, put it in `test/conftest.py`, where the in-package suites
pay nothing for it.

## Rule 1 — The side-effect floor: what actually leaks

Work down this list. Each item is a real leak that has happened here.

### 1a. Temp directories — register the destruction in the SAME scope

Prefer `tmp_path`. If you need `mkdtemp()`, register cleanup with `addCleanup` on the
**next line** — never an `rmtree` in `tearDown`, because `unittest` skips `tearDown`
entirely when `setUp` raises, so that shape leaks on exactly the failing runs nobody
watches. The before/after example is in testing-conventions.md § Rules.

`ignore_errors=True` also **hides** a cleanup that could not finish, so it is not proof
of anything. The floor helps, but it is not your discipline: the rootdir conftest redirects
`tempfile`'s base per run, removes it, and **reports** residue — as a warning today, fatal
under `KIROCREW_TMP_RESIDUE_STRICT=1`. So a leak of yours will not necessarily turn CI red;
clean up anyway. (Staged rollout and its owner: testing-conventions.md § Rules.)

Why it earns a guard: `/tmp` is often a tmpfs with a fixed **inode** budget
(1,048,576 on the hosts this was measured on) and it returns `ENOSPC` to every other
process on the machine while **90% of the bytes are free**. It is not a tidiness issue,
it is a "your shell stops working" issue.

### 1b. The operator's data home, and `~/.kiro`, which is a DIFFERENT axis

`KIROCREW_HOME` is pinned per test at the rootdir, which is what makes `config_dir()`
safe — and it needs to be, because resolving it is **not a read**: it creates the home
and its marker, and can run the `~/.kirocrew` → `~/.kiro/crew` migration.

Six shapes escape the env var:

- **`monkeypatch.undo()` in the body of a test.** It reverts EVERY record on the shared
  instance — your own patches, every fixture that set something through it (`stores`
  pins `KIROCREW_HOME` that way), and until the floor got its own instance, the floor
  itself. A restore that ran `empty_trash()` after `undo()` emptied the operator's real
  trash. A patch you need to drop before the test ends goes in
  `with pytest.MonkeyPatch.context() as patched:`; `undo()` is not a scoped tool.
- **A detached task.** `asyncio.create_task(...)` at boot with no one awaiting it keeps
  running after the test that started it has returned; when its work resolves a path
  (`peek_next` → `spool_path()` → `data_home()`, on a `to_thread` worker) it resolves
  the OPERATOR's home. Fixed where the task is scheduled: `_start_channel_transports`
  resolves `spool_path()` on the loop and hands it to the task, so the worker reads a
  location fixed at boot. Resolve every environment-derived input of a detached task on
  the calling side before detaching, or give the test a handle it can await.
- **What a closed loop leaves behind.** pytest-asyncio 0.20 ends the loop with a bare
  `loop.close()`. A pending task's coroutine then gets `GeneratorExit` at garbage
  collection, so its `finally` blocks run *then* (`_run_chat`'s queue cycle reaches a
  sync `KiroCrewConfig.load()`); a default-executor job (`to_thread`) is abandoned
  mid-flight. Both resolved `config_dir()` after the unpin and grew a fresh fake
  `HOME`'s `~/.kiro/crew`. The floor's `tryfirst` teardown hook now cancels pending
  tasks, runs them to completion and joins the executor while the pins hold, the way
  `asyncio.run` shuts down. A `coroutine ... was never awaited` warning pointing at that
  hook means your test left an unstarted turn behind: await it, or keep the patch that
  was meant to catch it in force until it has run.
- **A default that bypasses the pin on purpose.** `PodConfig.load()` derives the pod
  plane from `_default_home()` / `Path.home()` so a pod cannot redirect the host's
  registry; the floor pins `KIROCREW_POD_ROOT` / `KIROCREW_POD_ENV_DIR` for that reason.
  A new resolver with its own default gets a floor pin AND a ratchet in
  `test_host_isolation_floor.py` in the same change.
- **Import-time from `config_dir()`** (`subagent_persistence._SUBAGENTS_DIR`): the var
  is read after the module captured the path. Each has its own autouse pin. A
  **collection-time probe** is the same shape one step earlier: a module-level
  `_can_spawn()` used by a `skipif` runs before any pin and read the REAL
  `config.json`; run such probes under an empty `KIROCREW_HOME`.
- **Import-time from `Path.home()`**: `~/.kiro` is *kiro-cli's* home, machine-wide and
  shared with the real installed agent — `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` is the live
  agent's MCP server list. `_isolate_shared_kiro_paths` redirects these from a table,
  and `test/test_host_isolation_floor.py` **fails when `src/` grows a new one**. That
  ratchet covers IMPORT-TIME bindings only. The lazy resolver
  `config.paths.kiro_home()` — and so `kiro_agents_dir()` / `kiro_sessions_dir()` — is
  yours to isolate, with `KIRO_HOME` or by patching `Path.home()`; they are not
  interchangeable, because the env var outranks the other. A test that skipped this
  projected the developer's *installed* agent specs and failed with an
  `AcpRuntimeError` naming a prompt file in an unrelated worktree.

  Some entries are excluded, and for two opposite reasons — already redirected
  elsewhere (the macOS launchd set, moved as one group by `_isolate_launchd_paths`),
  or a **security anchor that must never move**: the file browser's allow-list root
  `file_explorer/server._HOME`. **Stub the reader, never
  move the anchor.** Redirecting a matcher so a test can pass makes it assert against a
  pattern that no longer matches the thing it protects. An anchor that stops being an
  import-time `Path.home()` binding leaves this tripwire's reach entirely —
  `kiro_usage_api`'s kiro-cli sqlite tuples now resolve the home inside
  `identity_stores.sqlite_dbs()`, so their anchor rule is pinned by
  `test_identity_stores.py::TestUsageTuplesAnchorTheRealHome` instead. Read
  `_EXCLUDED` for the live list rather than a copy here.

### 1c. A child process inherits pytest's CWD, which is the repo root

This is the leak a reviewer cannot see: no line says `open(..., "w")`, the write
happens in a grandchild, and the test can assert against `tmp_path` and pass while the
artifact sits in the checkout. An empty file produced this way has been committed and
shipped from this repo.

- Pass `cwd=<a directory under tmp_path>` to any child that MAY create a file, and to
  every helper that spawns one.
- Scope the assertion to where that child's CWD actually **is**. An assertion over
  `tmp_path` proves nothing about a child that ran somewhere else — and a security test
  whose payload escapes its own assertion is worse than no test, because it reports a
  guarantee it never checked.
- A read-only query is exempt, and sometimes must be: `git check-ignore` against the
  checkout is asking a question *about the checkout*.

The rootdir conftest fails the run on new non-ignored entries at the repository root,
which is how this announces itself.

Two more things a spawning test owes, both learned from processes that outlived the run
by **six days**, spinning at 1464% CPU between them:

- **`HOME` and `PATH` are a PAIR.** If you hand a child a fabricated environment,
  substituting one while inheriting the other is the defect. An inherited `PATH` on a
  developer host routinely leads with a version-manager shim directory (mise, asdf,
  pyenv, volta, nodenv), and a shim resolves its tool set from `HOME` — so with a
  substituted `HOME` the bare name `python3` or `node` reaches the MANAGER, which finds
  no tool state and never execs anything. It spins, forever. Pin the real interpreter's
  own directory first on `PATH`, or resolve the tool to its real executable before
  building the env. Do not drop the `HOME` substitution instead: it is usually a
  blast-radius bound somebody chose on purpose.
- **Reap the process GROUP, on every exit path.** A child is routinely a wrapper that
  forks, so `Popen.kill()` reaps the wrapper and leaves the real work running — and a
  bounded `wait()` ending in a bare `pass` then reports success. Use
  `start_new_session=True` + `os.killpg` on POSIX and `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` +
  `taskkill /T /F` on Windows; `test/installer_test_helpers.run_bounded` is the
  reference. A `try/finally` around the whole post-spawn body, not just the timeout
  branch, is what makes "every exit path" true.

### 1d. Background lifecycle — the one that beats every filesystem cleanup

**A singleton with a daemon thread cannot be cleaned up by tidying files.** The worked
example is `sel.py`: `SecurityEventLog` is a process singleton, its writer is a daemon
thread, and `_init_locked` binds the directory **once** from whatever `_default_dir()`
resolved then. So the first test to call `sel()` fixes it for the whole worker, the
thread keeps writing after that test ends, and `_flush_batch` opens with
`mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)` — **re-creating the directory after tearDown
deleted it**. MEASURED: exactly one stray directory per run of the ops-mission-control
suite. Full telling, with the stack it came from:
[testing-conventions.md](../../../../../docs/system-specs/common/testing-conventions.md)
§ Rules.

The fix was not better cleanup. It was giving the singleton a **session-scoped**
directory belonging to no individual test. When you touch a subsystem with a background
worker, ask: *which directory did its thread capture, and does anything delete that
directory underneath it?*

**The same shape, one level up: a stub that replaces a `shutdown`/`close`/`stop` is
not a stop.** Three tests needed to observe *that* the metrics provider's `shutdown`
was called, so they replaced it with a recorder — and the real `shutdown` is what stops
OpenTelemetry's exporter thread. That thread then survived for the life of the worker,
and because the OTel SDK reinstalls it in every fork child via `os.register_at_fork`,
the sandbox's userns probe forked a MULTITHREADED child. `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)`
implies `CLONE_THREAD`, which the kernel refuses with EINVAL unless the caller is
single-threaded, and EINVAL is indistinguishable from "no `CONFIG_USER_NS`" — so the
worker cached "this host has no sandbox backend" and every later sandboxed spawn failed
closed. 19 red tests in two app suites, each passing alone, none of them a metrics test.
**Spy and delegate; never replace a lifecycle method.** The rootdir conftest now fails
the test that leaves an exporter thread running.

Two general lessons worth carrying out of that one: a thread whose target is a bound
method keeps its own object alive, so dropping references never collects it; and
anything registered with `os.register_at_fork` runs inside `os.fork()`, before it
returns, so a fork child is not reliably single-threaded.

Related traps in the same family:

- **A `MagicMock` config reads TRUTHY.** Patching `KiroCrewConfig.load` with a bare
  `MagicMock` makes `cfg.telemetry.enabled` truthy, which starts a real recorder and a
  reader thread, and resolves `Path(cfg.local_dir)` to a *relative* path that writes
  into the repo. That is why `KIROCREW_TELEMETRY=0` is forced for the whole suite. Any
  subsystem gated on a truthy attribute read off a config object has this shape.
- **A sleeper child that outlives the test.** The suite spawns
  `python -c "import time; time.sleep(30)"` to simulate a hung process. Put the
  kill/wait in a `finally` or an `addCleanup`, never only on the happy path.
- **A fixed port.** Bind port `0`. A fixed number collides across xdist workers *and*
  with the operator's running gateway.

### 1e. Never leave the process working directory somewhere else

The CWD is per-PROCESS, so under xdist one test's `os.chdir` becomes every later test's
starting directory on that worker. Use `monkeypatch.chdir`, which reverts itself.

This is the leak with the widest blast radius measured here. Because a passing test's
`tmp_path` is removed at its own teardown, a test that chdirs into `tmp_path` and does
not come back leaves the worker in a **deleted** directory, and `Path.cwd()` then raises
`FileNotFoundError` for every later test that reaches it — including from inside
production code. The measured instance is in
[testing-conventions.md](../../../../../docs/system-specs/common/testing-conventions.md)
§ Rules; the shape to recognise is that it reads as "the suite is flaky" — many files,
each passing in isolation. The rootdir conftest restores the CWD before any fixture
teardown, but write the test so it would not need to.

### 1f. Never register a real cron job, and never touch a real service

The rootdir conftest traps the stdlib spawn funnels and refuses a
`systemctl`/`launchctl` invocation carrying a **mutating verb**. Read-only queries
(`show`, `cat`, `is-active`) are allowed and need no stub. A test reaching the make-live
cutover path must stub **both** `_run_cmd` and `_dropin_path`.

## Rule 2 — Determinism: six classes, one correct fix each

Never "fix" a flake with a rerun, a longer `sleep`, a weakened assertion, or a skip.
Full detail and examples: testing-conventions § Determinism.

The six classes, the tell that identifies each, and the ONE correct fix for each are in
[testing-conventions.md](../../../../../docs/system-specs/common/testing-conventions.md)
§ Determinism. Read the section matching your symptom before changing anything: most of them
have a fix that looks like the obvious one and is not.

What this skill adds is when to go looking — a test that passes alone and fails in the suite, or
one that splits by Python version rather than by machine load, is one of those six and not a
mystery. Do not reach for a rerun, a longer `sleep`, a weakened assertion, or a skip.

The sixth class has a tell of its own: **the run ends early, not red.** On Windows a test that
blocks past `--timeout` is not failed, its xdist worker is killed, and with
`--max-worker-restart=0` the run aborts with every uncollected result missing. If a full run
reports a few thousand tests instead of ~60k, look for `worker ... crashed while running` in the
log: the named test is one that can wait forever. Wait on the observable state, not a guessed
`sleep`, and bound the await whose refusal is under test with `asyncio.wait_for` so a missed
refusal fails by name at that line.

An adjacent trap: **a patch target that misses.** Patch the namespace whose
globals the code under test actually reads. It fails in both directions — patching a
package re-export when the caller reads its own defining module, or patching
`pkg.mod.fn` when the caller did `from pkg.mod import fn` and holds its own binding.
Either way the real function runs, the assertion passes for the wrong reason, and the
test pays real time. **Treat an unexpectedly slow "mocked" test as evidence the mock
missed.** The opposite trap is a patch that is too WIDE: a side effect on a module global
also fires for every background worker that calls it (the `eventlog-io` legacy fold calls
`members.read_dm_binding`). Patch the function awaited in the window you mean, and pin
the order of the calls the test relies on.

Another: **the host is an input, and a "surely-unused" number is not a constant.**
`999999` reads as an impossible PID and is not — `pid_max` is 4194304, so on a
long-running host it names a live process. That broke two tests in opposite ways: one
stopped pruning an entry whose owner "must be dead", and one accused a planted `ps` shim
of executing when it had not. If the code *probes* the PID, pin the probe; if the number
must never appear in real output, pick one no OS can allocate (`99999999999`).

The host's free MEMORY is an input too, and the most-used probe of it is
`SubagentManager.spawn`, which queues — registering nothing in `_tasks` — on a
pressured machine. A queued spawn is still a `SubagentInfo`, so the test dies a line
later on a bare `KeyError`, not on the assert that would have named the cause. Any
file driving `spawn` takes `pytestmark = pytest.mark.usefixtures("healthy_host_memory")`,
and `test_subagent_spawn_host_pin.py` fails when a new one does not. The guard it
pins, and why it stays transparent for the parser's own tests, are in
testing-conventions § Determinism 1. Both the fixture and its ratchet are
`test/`-only — `healthy_host_memory` lives in `test/conftest.py`, and
`test_subagent_spawn_host_pin.py` scans `test/*.py` non-recursively. An in-package
app suite cannot request the fixture and is not swept, so a test there that drives
`SubagentManager.spawn` must pin the floor reading itself.

One more, for tests of a **single-flight or coalescing** path ("N concurrent readers
share ONE scan"): the property only holds for readers that arrive WHILE the shared
operation is in flight, so the test has to keep it in flight until they have. An
instant stub does not: `asyncio.gather` starts the leader first, its executor job
finishes on the pool thread before the loop reaches the `await`, and on Python 3.13
the wrapped future is already done — awaiting a done future does not yield. The
leader then completes with a waiter count of one and the next reader assembles again,
once in five loaded runs. Gate the stub on a `threading.Event`, poll until every
reader is registered, then release it. Whatever the count of assemblies asserts, the
test must first establish the concurrency it is asserting about.

## Rule 3 — Cross-platform: macOS, Linux (x86_64 + arm64), Windows

- **Route POSIX calls through `platform_compat`.** See docs/system-specs/common/platform-compat.md. Most
  important: `os.kill(pid, 0)` **TERMINATES** the target on Windows — it is not a
  liveness probe. Use `platform_compat.pid_exists`.
- **Path length is a real constraint.** Windows caps a path at 260 characters unless
  long paths are enabled, and a macOS `AF_UNIX` `sun_path` is capped at ~104 bytes —
  which a macOS `basetemp` alone already exceeds. That is why
  `test/tmpdir_helpers.short_tmp_base()` exists, and why anything that prefixes every
  temp path in the suite has to be measured, not assumed.
- **Case-insensitive filesystems.** macOS and Windows are case-insensitive by default,
  so a test asserting that two paths differing only in case are distinct is broken
  there.
- **Windows timer granularity** rounds `sleep`/`Event.wait` up to ~15.6ms and has
  coarser file mtime resolution — so "two writes have different timestamps" is a flake
  there.
- **Probe, do not guess the platform.** `test/conftest.py::_can_create_symlink` is the
  model: creating a symlink needs `SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege`, which CI runners
  hold and an ordinary shell does not, so a blanket `skipif(IS_WINDOWS)` would drop the
  assertion exactly where it needs to run. Use the `make_escaping_link` /
  `make_dir_link` helpers, which fall back to a junction.
- **arm64 vs x86_64** rarely matters for test logic, but check it when you touch memory
  or page arithmetic (`SC_PAGE_SIZE` is 16K on some arm64 configurations) or a
  dependency with per-architecture wheels.
- Windows gaps are tracked as burn-down lists, not scattered skips:
  `test/windows-collect-ignore.txt` and `test/windows-expected-failures.txt`. Anything
  NOT listed still fails the job. Delete a line when you fix its test.
- **Never `--deselect` a whole file for a missing host capability.** Guard the test that
  needs it — `skipif(not userns_available())` for the OS sandbox — so the report names the
  capability. A deselect is invisible in the output, takes the file's other tests with it,
  and never goes red when its reason expires: eleven such files kept 608 tests off every
  PR, of which 523 would have run on all three platforms, long after the cost that
  justified the exclusion had been fixed.

## Rule 4 — Diagnosing a residue failure

The residue report runs in a session-fixture teardown, so it is attributed to the **last
test the worker ran**, which is almost never the culprit. The guard carries its own
bisector — use it instead of guessing:

```bash
KIROCREW_TMP_PER_TEST=1 pytest src/kiro_crew/apps/builtins/<app>/tests -n0 -q
# AssertionError: 1 temporary entry outlived this run under /tmp/kc-pytest-you-951504:
#     test_provider_listing_never_contains_a_token/tmpw2kvty2z
```

Each residue name becomes `<test id>/<leaked name>`. If the leak survives a `tearDown`
that visibly removes it, suspect Rule 1d: something **re-created** the path after
cleanup. Confirm by wrapping `os.mkdir` in a throwaway `-p` plugin and printing a stack
for paths under the run's temp root — that is how the `sel-writer` thread was found.

For a repository-root residue failure, the cause is almost always Rule 1c: a subprocess
spawned without `cwd=`.

## Rule 5 — Keep the parallel suite fast

At ~56.5k tests, **per-test setup cost dominates any single slow test** — an autouse
fixture is paid ~56,500 times. Profile, never guess; compare candidates back to back on
the same host (run the change, then the base in `git worktree add --detach <dir> <base>`;
never `git stash`: every worktree shares one stash list), because a loaded host makes an
absolute number meaningless.

The recurring wins, in order of leverage:

1. **An autouse fixture that costs more than it protects** — one requesting a
   `tmp_path` it never uses; a repeated `tmp_path_factory.mktemp` (it scans the whole
   basetemp to pick its suffix, so it slows as siblings accumulate); an unconditional
   `mkdir` where the consumer only needs a *path*. Measure the whole chain against a
   file of trivial `assert True` tests.
2. **A production timeout or poll the test never asserts on** — `monkeypatch` the
   interval to `0`; the branch still executes, only the waiting goes.
3. **An expensive immutable thing built per test** — a real `git` repo costs ~1–1.6s in
   subprocesses. Build it once `scope="session"` and `copytree` it per test; copy *from*
   the template rather than yielding it, so nothing one test does can reach another's.
4. **A module-cached tree scan paid once per WORKER** — an `lru_cache`d `rglob` +
   `ast.parse` of `src/` (~30 s) is computed again on every xdist worker the module's
   tests land on; five full runs measured eighteen ratchet modules each re-scanning on
   3–5 workers, ~22 CPU-minutes per run. Add
   `pytestmark = pytest.mark.xdist_group(name="tree_scan_<module>")` — one group per
   file, never one shared group — and the scan runs once per run.

**After any speedup, mutate the production code the test covers and confirm the test
still FAILS.** A test made faster by checking less is a regression. Restore from a copy
of the file you mutated, not from git — `git checkout --` discards unrelated uncommitted
work — and sequence with `;`, not `&&`, or the restore only runs when the mutation
did *not* work.

## Rule 6 — MEMORY is the other budget, and collection is most of it

A worker costs ~2.0 GiB (measured median at `-n 12`; worst observed 2.8 GiB), and
~1,499 MiB of that is paid before your test runs: every xdist worker independently
collects every item in both testpaths (106,491), and 99% of that footprint is private,
so more workers never amortize it. This is why `-n auto` is bounded by available memory
— on an 8–16 GiB laptop the full suite otherwise swaps the machine.

Both halves of that model doubled between audits (from ~57k items / ~750 MiB), so
**re-measure rather than trusting the numbers above** once the suite grows by half
again: `--collect-only -n0` reproduces a worker's collection peak. The reservation in
`xdist_budget.py` is sized on them, and an under-sized reservation is how a laptop
starts swapping.

The consequence for how you write a test:

- **An allocation at module scope is multiplied by every worker, and outlives the
  test.** A big literal inside `@pytest.mark.parametrize` is the worst shape: it is
  built while the module is IMPORTED and the mark keeps it alive on the function
  object for the whole session, so one test's payload is charged to all of them. Two
  such literals — a 64 MiB frame and a 40 MB string — cost 102 MiB per worker until
  they were moved into the test bodies behind a sentinel.
- **A transient peak counts too**, because a worker's high-water mark is what the
  budget must reserve. Building an image as a list of per-pixel tuples cost ~390 MiB
  for a 17 MB PNG; one `frombytes` over a bytes buffer was 10x smaller and
  byte-equivalent.
- **Derive a size from the production constant** rather than restating it. A literal
  `40_000_001` beside a `_MAX_LAYER_B_CHARS` of `40_000_000` hides both the coupling
  and the cost, and goes stale silently.
- Suspect a **module-scope literal** whenever a file's collection RSS is large; measure
  it with `pytest <file> --collect-only` and `/proc/self/status`'s `VmHWM`.

## Checklist before you push a test

- [ ] Nothing outlives the run: no temp residue, no write to `~/.kiro` or the real data
      home, no cron job, no service change, no file in the checkout
- [ ] Every `mkdtemp` has `addCleanup` on the next line (or uses `tmp_path`)
- [ ] Every child that may create a file gets `cwd=` under `tmp_path`, and every
      assertion is scoped to where that child actually ran
- [ ] Anything whose default directory is `Path.cwd()` (`TaskRunner(work_dir=...)`) is
      constructed with an explicit `tmp_path`; a gitignored name at the repo root is the
      one leak the residue guard cannot see
- [ ] A background worker gets every environment-derived input (paths AND config) from the
      dispatching thread, and registers itself so the rootdir conftest teardown can join it
- [ ] Every thread, task, child process, socket and connection it starts is stopped in a
      `finally` or an `addCleanup`
- [ ] Globals mutated through `monkeypatch`, never raw assignment — including `os.environ`
      keys a REAL production startup path is known to write (`PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_OUTPUT_DIR`,
      `KIROCREW_TELEMETRY`, `PATH`), restored in the shared helper that drives it
- [ ] A variable the code under test WRITES and that is absent before the test goes
      through `forget_env_at_teardown(monkeypatch, name)` — `delenv(raising=False)` on an
      absent key records no undo, and a `delenv` AFTER the write puts the written value back
- [ ] No `monkeypatch.undo()` in a test body: it reverts every fixture's records too. A
      patch you need to drop early lives in `with pytest.MonkeyPatch.context() as patched:`
- [ ] No module-level `skipif` probe that reads `KiroCrewConfig` / `config_dir()` /
      `Path.home()` — it runs before any pin and observes the operator's real config
- [ ] A collection-time probe that can construct a process singleton (`sel()`, a config
      loader) RETIRES it before its temp home is removed — the session floor only resets
      singletons at the first test's setup, and a live one re-creates the deleted path
- [ ] Every `MagicMock` attribute the code under test converts or compares (`int()`,
      `len()`, `bool()`, `<`) is set explicitly in the mock helper — `int(MagicMock())`
      is 1, and a drain loop reads that as "one still pending" until its deadline. A
      test whose duration equals a production timeout has hit this
- [ ] A complexity guard (ReDoS, "stays linear") is sized so the regression it exists to
      catch FAILS it inside `--timeout` rather than hangs the worker: RAMP the pump one
      unit at a time on thread CPU (`assert_rejected_without_backtracking`), never a single
      huge input on a wall clock — no fixed "small" size is safe against every growth rate
- [ ] A test of a refused location names one the guard refuses on THIS host: `/usr` is
      `C:\usr` on Windows — accepted by the resolver, and then created on the system drive
- [ ] Fixture paths are absolute on EVERY host: `host_abs("usr", "bin")`, never a `/usr/bin`
      literal (`ntpath.isabs` rejects a driveless path from Python 3.13); a path that belongs
      to a simulated platform is judged with that platform's module (`posixpath`)
- [ ] Nothing assumes the ancestry of `tmp_path` is bare (no `.venv`, no project marker
      above it), that `127.0.0.1:1` refuses connections, that `python3` is on PATH (spawn
      `sys.executable`), or that `git`/`gh` sit in a trusted system directory
- [ ] A fabricated child environment does not substitute `HOME` while inheriting `PATH`
      (or vice versa): with a shim-led `PATH` the bare `python3`/`node` is a
      version manager that finds no tool state under the new `HOME` and spins forever
- [ ] Every child that could outlive the test is reaped by process GROUP
      (`start_new_session=True` + `os.killpg`; `taskkill /T /F` on Windows) from a
      `try/finally` around the whole post-spawn body, not only the timeout branch
- [ ] A `skipif` on an external tool gates on the VERSION floor the code needs, not just
      `shutil.which(tool) is not None`
- [ ] A gate that walks the REPO ROOT prunes `.worktrees/` (another branch's checkout),
      or asks `git ls-files` instead of walking
- [ ] A fixture that stubs away the only code path releasing a permit, lock or in-flight
      claim gives it back itself — restored to what the test INHERITED, not to a
      pristine value
- [ ] A source ratchet strips docstrings with `ast`, not by subtracting `__doc__` from
      `inspect.getsource` (3.13 dedents docstrings)
- [ ] A test whose contract IS a real symlink is listed in `test/requires-real-symlinks.txt`;
      one that needs a directory that resolves elsewhere uses `make_dir_link`
- [ ] No `AsyncMock` standing in for a synchronous method; every `cancel()` awaited. A
      bare `AsyncMock()` provider makes EVERY accessor an awaitable, and the sync ones
      (`context_window_tokens()`, `mcp_session_report()`) become `never awaited` warnings
      attributed to a LATER test — build the double from a factory that pins them as
      `MagicMock`, and a stand-in for a spawner or `wait_for` must `close()` the coroutine
      it swallows
- [ ] No module-level asyncio primitive (`Lock`/`Event`/`Future`/in-flight dict) reachable
      from the code under test without a per-test reset
- [ ] Nothing can block forever: every await the test itself must unblock is wrapped in a
      bounded `wait_for`; no `sleep(0.05)` standing in for "let the other task register"
- [ ] A test of a coalescing / single-flight path holds the shared operation open (a
      gated stub) until every reader has registered, then releases it — an instant stub
      lets the leader finish before the others arrive, and a done future never yields
- [ ] A module that `rglob`+`ast.parse`s `src/` once per module also carries
      `pytestmark = pytest.mark.xdist_group(name="tree_scan_<module>")`, or every xdist
      worker it touches re-runs the scan
- [ ] A scan of the WHOLE repo goes through `source_corpus.repo_files()` /
      `repo_files_named(...)`, never `rglob`/`os.walk` from the root — a walk descends
      gitignored trees and any nested worktree, so the gate reports that copy as the
      offender, or (with an `any(...)` assertion) keeps passing on it; the gate keeps its
      own scope filter, because `_vendor` is tracked
- [ ] A fixture stamped from a module-level `NOW` is only compared by production code
      whose clock is pinned to that same `NOW` (a `frozen_clock` fixture) -- never two clocks
- [ ] After `await handler(...)`, an assertion on something a worker thread emits via
      `call_soon_threadsafe` waits on that signal, not on the handler returning
- [ ] No assertion on a rate, a sample count, or an absolute duration
- [ ] Source files read via `_REPO_ROOT = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[N]`, never a
      relative `Path("src/...")` — xdist workers may change CWD
- [ ] Passes at `-n0` **and** under `-n auto`, and passes when run alone
- [ ] No large allocation at module scope — especially not inside `parametrize`, where
      every worker pays it at collection and holds it for the session
- [ ] Cross-platform: `platform_compat` for process/signal/lock calls, no assumption
      about path separators, case sensitivity, `/tmp`, or timer granularity
- [ ] `@pytest.mark.asyncio` only on `async def` tests — never a module-level `pytestmark`
      over a file that also holds sync tests
- [ ] Every aiohttp `app[...]` write happens before the `TestClient`/`TestServer` starts; an
      override of something a production `on_startup` hook creates is itself a later
      `on_startup` hook; an already-set-up runner's app is never wrapped in a second
      `TestServer` (serve `runner.server` through a `ServerRunner`)
- [ ] A fixture venv is built with `symlinks=not IS_WINDOWS`, and every probe of the
      RUNNING interpreter's packaging (`find_spec("pip")`) is pinned — a uv venv has no
      `pip`, and a copied python-build-standalone binary does not start
- [ ] A fake `subprocess.run` routes on whole argv tokens, never on a substring of the
      joined argv — a `TMPDIR` path element can contain any word, including the test's id
- [ ] A directory chmodded to a non-writable mode under `tmp_path` gets owner rwx back in a
      finalizer; a nested pytest the test spawns gets `--basetemp` under the outer
      `tmp_path` (the default is the SHARED per-user tree every other run prunes)
- [ ] A module- or session-scoped fixture that patches env does it through
      `pytest.MonkeyPatch.context()` scoped to what actually needs it, never a raw
      `os.environ[...]` write and never a `MonkeyPatch` held for the whole module when the
      value it builds is already materialised; an env value each test's subprocess must
      see (a git identity) is set per test through the function-scoped `monkeypatch`,
      since a session-lifetime patch still reaches every later suite on the worker
- [ ] A default that is not HOME-derived (`workspace_root()` → `/Volumes/workplace` on
      macOS) is relocated by patching the resolver, and the result is asserted to be under
      `tmp_path`
- [ ] A resolver that finds a per-user tool (`gh`, `mise`, `say`) is pinned at the seam
      production reads, never left to find the host's binary; an address probe that
      `connect`s a datagram socket off-loopback is stubbed with an inert socket subclass
- [ ] A stub for a runner that owns deferred cleanup (`cleanup_paths`) reaps them itself;
      a file with a `.lock` sidecar lives under `tmp_path`; a spawned real binary gets
      `TMPDIR`/`TMP`/`TEMP` inside the test's temp tree in its `env`
- [ ] A thread count that rises is only a leak if the new threads are not a named bounded
      pool (`mc-*`, `sel-writer`) — print thread names in the probe first; a
      `Thread(target=lambda: ...)` that is expected to raise captures the exception and
      asserts on it instead of leaving a `PytestUnhandledThreadExceptionWarning`
- [ ] A tree ratchet streams parsed trees and caches RESULTS, never a list of ASTs shared
      between scanners; a growth/linearity ratchet measures the algorithm's own work
      (bytes produced, items visited), not wall-clock and not interpreter call counts
      (`str.join` is one C call at any length)
- [ ] Nothing assumes `tmp_path` is OUTSIDE a git repository: a fixture whose verdict comes
      from an upward walk (nearest `.git`, `install.sh` + `setup.cfg`, project markers from
      the cwd, git discovery) plants the boundary it reads — a developer's `TMPDIR` may sit
      inside the checkout, and in a linked worktree the `.git` such a walk finds is a FILE
- [ ] A nested `python -m pytest` on files under `tmp_path` passes its own `-c <ini>`,
      `--rootdir` and `--color=no`: otherwise it adopts the repository's ini, and the
      repo `addopts` reshape the very output the outer test greps
- [ ] A stub for an `os.*` function reached through a module alias
      (`monkeypatch.setattr("<mod>.os.unlink", ...)`) forwards every non-owned call to the
      saved real function with `*args, **kwargs` INTACT — dropping `dir_fd` re-aims pytest's
      own `rmtree` at the cwd — and asserts a bare relative name never reaches the stub
- [ ] A test that compiles or imports a throwaway source under `tmp_path` keeps its bytecode
      there (`sys.pycache_prefix` under `tmp_path`, or the suite's `no_bytecode()` helper),
      because the suite-wide mirror is keyed on the absolute source path and a per-run path
      never gets read again
- [ ] A fixture needing a SHORT path (`AF_UNIX` `sun_path`, a redaction-sensitive path) calls
      `tmpdir_helpers.short_tmp_base()` — never a literal `/tmp`, and never
      `tempfile.gettempdir()`, which is too long under a pinned `TMPDIR`
- [ ] No raw `os.kill(pid, 0)` in test code — it TERMINATES the target on Windows; route
      liveness through `platform_compat.pid_exists`/`pid_liveness`, and any teardown signal
      to a pid published by a child captures the target's identity at spawn and revalidates
      before signalling
- [ ] Every fetch seam a code path can take is routed, not just the one the happy path uses
      (a JSON + text stub still lets a BLOB fetch reach the network)
- [ ] A skip condition is decidable the same way on every run of one host: no ctime tick, no
      "did a real tool answer in time", no "did an earlier test in this worker arm a hook" —
      build the condition, resolve it from disk, or measure in a fresh interpreter
- [ ] A handle the object under test opens for the process lifetime (a store's SQLite
      connection + writer thread, a lazily-opened index) is closed by the fixture that built
      it; when production has no close path, that gap is the finding
- [ ] No exception INSTANCE in a `parametrize` list (`pytest.param(OSError(...))`): the
      instance lives for the module, `raise err` hangs a `__traceback__` on it, and the
      frames on that traceback keep every local alive — a handle, a lease, a socket — for
      the rest of the worker. Parametrize the errno and build the exception inside the test
- [ ] A test that asserts process-global "nothing retained" state (`lease._held`, a
      registry, a pool) is only as good as the files that share the worker: the file that
      exercises the failure path pins the same table empty in its own teardown, so the
      retention is reported where it was created rather than forty files later
- [ ] "Let it finish" is never a fixed `sleep`: wait on the state you are about to assert
      (poll it off-loop under a bounded deadline, or await its event) — two 200 ms sleeps
      that were enough at `-n0` read `starting` for every row on a loaded Windows worker
- [ ] A store that hands each THREAD its own connection (`KnowledgeStore`) is torn down with
      `_close_all_for_tests()`, never `close()` — `close()` releases the calling thread's handle and
      leaves the ones `asyncio.to_thread` workers opened; and every inline `VectorMemoryStore`
      / `SkillsLoader` / `SubagentManager` goes through the module's `opened` register-and-close
      fixture, because an unclosed `sqlite3.Connection` is a self-cycle on 3.11+ and refcounting
      never frees its `db`/`-wal`/`-shm`
- [ ] A fixture that plants a path under `tmp_path` and asserts a production "not under
      `$HOME`" refusal does NOT fire pins `Path.home` (the seam the product reads) to a
      sibling that is not an ancestor of the fixture — a developer's `TMPDIR` may sit inside
      home — and a mirror test plants INSIDE the patched home to prove the refusal still fires
- [ ] A helper that asserts a WARNING count filters `caplog.records` by the logger the test
      enabled (`rec.name == <logger>`), never the unfiltered root capture: an executor thread
      another test's `SessionManager` armed logs on its own logger mid-test; and a test that
      builds a real `SessionManager` relies on conftest's `_no_boot_sandbox_sweep` pin rather
      than patching the sweep itself unless the sweep is its subject
- [ ] A teardown that signals a pid the body has already proven dead (a reaped root, a
      grandchild init collected) signals only while `process_start_time` still matches the
      identity recorded at spawn, and refuses an unpinned pid; a "nonexistent pid" probe uses a
      number above `/proc/sys/kernel/pid_max`, not a convention
- [ ] A resolver the product caches for the process (`functools.lru_cache`d `ssh -V`,
      `code_fingerprint()`) is pinned at MODULE scope with an explicit opt-out fixture — pinning
      only the flagged tests moves the real spawn to the next reader; a class-local copy of a
      conftest fixture re-implements ALL of its pins or requests the original instead
- [ ] A production `git -C <scratch>` spawn the test cannot pass `cwd=` to runs under a
      fixture `monkeypatch.chdir(tmp_path)`, so nothing inherits the checkout as process cwd;
      the product keeps `cwd=None` there on purpose (a missing clone must stay git's rc=128,
      not a `FileNotFoundError` before git runs)
- [ ] A backend a daemon reaps on disconnect goes through the pool's TRACKED reap
      (`pool.spawn_shutdown`), never an inline `await shutdown()` in a handler's `finally`:
      teardown cancels the handler after the backend has left the map, and the child then
      belongs to nobody
- [ ] A child whose environment or argv the test must READ BACK through the kernel
      (`KERN_PROCARGS2`, `/proc/<pid>/environ`) is a non-platform binary -- the test's own
      `sys.executable` -- never `sleep` or `env`: macOS 26 answers an argv-only record for
      Apple platform binaries even to a same-uid reader, so the oracle reads `None` and a
      "refused" assertion passes for the wrong reason
- [ ] The bounds on nested `python -m pytest` runs fit INSIDE the per-test `--timeout`: N
      sequential children each capped at 60 s inside a 120 s test can only fail the test
      ahead of pytest-timeout, never protect it; independent children run concurrently
      (wall = the slowest) and each gets the outer budget less a margin
- [ ] A handle the product REWRITES asynchronously (a claim's `.task` that the run swaps for
      its inner task) is never read off shared state after an awaited response -- take it
      from the seam that hands it over (`attach_run_task`), or the assertion names whichever
      task won the race
- [ ] A fixture never answers a production path with a FIXED absolute host location to keep
      a golden host-free: the product WRITES into the window it is handed (`record_owner`
      unlinks `.owner`, the gate probe `shutil.rmtree`s it), and a path that "never exists"
      is one `mkdir` on some host away from a real deletion -- answer a real directory under
      `tmp_path` and stub the golden's env contribution instead
- [ ] A test whose red survives neither running the file ALONE nor running it WITHOUT
      `-p probe_plugin` is the probe's finding, not the suite's: a per-test observer that
      reaches `os.path` through the module a spied test patches records itself as the code
      under test
- [ ] A child that polices its OWN peak memory reads `/proc/self/status` `VmHWM` on Linux,
      never `getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF).ru_maxrss`: `execve` seeds `ru_maxrss` with the parent's
      high-water mark, so a child of a 2 GiB xdist worker (or gateway) reads over its ceiling
      before it has parsed a byte -- green at `-n0`, red under the suite; the test that pins
      it plants a BLOATED PARENT and asserts the child still finishes
- [ ] A test that plants a fake executable under `tmp_path` and expects a guard LATER than
      the working-tree fence to fire pins the fence root (`_WORKTREE_ROOT`) to a `tmp_path`
      sibling that is not the fake's ancestor -- under a repo-internal `TMPDIR` the fence
      wins first, and a patched `which()` that answers the fake for `git` too can hide it on CI
- [ ] A module that boots the REAL `start_dashboard` pins
      `hooks_integration._lifecycle_dispatcher` / `_route_registry` to `None` BEFORE the boot
      (so `monkeypatch` restores them); a module whose assertions assume "never booted" says
      so with an autouse pin. Attribute a flaky 409 by its BODY (`hooks disable failed: ...
      MagicMock ... await`), not by the endpoint that answered
- [ ] A PTY test that asserts a child receives a signal gates the send on
      `os.tcgetpgrp` on the PTY's own descriptor leaving the shell's group -- the line-discipline ECHO of the
      command is not proof the shell has read it (`VINTR` flushes unread input and the test
      passes with no child ever born) -- and reaps the session group in a `finally`; a spawn
      that hands a shell a terminal resets inherited `SIG_IGN` to `SIG_DFL` first, because a
      backgrounded launcher's ignored SIGINT survives `exec` into every descendant
- [ ] A module-scoped autouse fixture never wraps the module in
      `mock.patch.dict(os.environ, {...})`: the keys are live between tests for every module
      the worker runs meanwhile, while the function-scoped conftest floor already overrides the
      home during each body -- set the feature flag per test with `monkeypatch.setenv`
- [ ] A memoised per-file read on a tree scan (`lru_cache` on `_read_text`, a `tuple(...)`
      corpus helper) keeps every file resident for the process; the seam streams, and the test
      consumes the iterator (count, path set, `zip(strict=True)`) instead of materialising it
- [ ] A test's own `kiro-cli --version` is never the HOST's: every agent-spec write reaches
      `installed_kiro_cli_version()`, cached per process, so the module pins it to
      `SPEC_PERMISSIONS_MIN_VERSION` (house fixture) or the host's install decides the
      contract under test
- [ ] A coreutil a real-bash harness must neutralise (`sleep` in a retry backoff) is a shell
      FUNCTION defined at the top of the driver script, never an executable planted earlier on
      `PATH`: Git for Windows' `bin\bash.exe` launcher prepends `/usr/bin` to whatever `PATH`
      it is handed, so the shim never wins there and every failing case sleeps the whole
      budget; record each call and assert the SCHEDULE, not the clock
- [ ] A Windows Job `ActiveProcessLimit` sized as "this child and nothing else" is
      `1 + platform_compat.python_launcher_hops()`: a venv's `Scripts\python.exe` is a
      redirector that spawns the real interpreter as its child, so a ceiling of exactly one
      refuses the spawn it was meant to bound (exit 101, `Unable to create process using`)
- [ ] A test that asserts a key PASSES THROUGH a scrub (`HOME`, `PATH`) plants that key in the
      parent first — CI runners export `HOME` on Windows, a server session does not, and the
      assertion otherwise measures the host
- [ ] A refusal raised by an object that holds a process-global resource (a crew-log handle
      and its write lease) is asserted through a CLASS-based context manager whose `__exit__`
      copies the exception's fields into a plain record and returns -- never
      `pytest.raises(...) as exc` (the `ExceptionInfo` and the test frame form a cycle that
      keeps `append`'s `self` alive until the cyclic collector runs) and never a
      `@contextlib.contextmanager` (throwing into a generator adds the same cycle through the
      generator's frame); the file's autouse teardown pins the table (`lease._held`) empty
      without `gc.collect()`
- [ ] A stand-in handed to a table that judges liveness by probe (`RUNTIME_TENANCY._alive`
      reads `is_alive` / `is_process_alive`) either answers the probe or its test releases the
      claim itself -- a fake with neither is alive for the rest of the worker -- and a stubbed
      `_dispose_*` still owes every release the real one performs
- [ ] A test that hands the reaper a reset that never returns (`_hanging_reset`) pins
      `_RESET_TIMEOUT` the way its sibling classes do; a passing test whose wall time lands on a
      product constant (30.0 s, 60.0 s) with the CPU idle is spending that constant, not
      measuring it -- `classify.py`'s TIMEOUT-SHAPED rows name them
- [ ] `monkeypatch.delenv(key, raising=False)` on a key that is ABSENT records no undo: when the
      product then `os.environ.setdefault`s it, `setenv` the key first so the fixture's undo
      removes whatever the product leaves
- [ ] A harness that runs a real shell script SUPPLIES every tool the script requires that
      the host may lack (`jq` beside the `gh` and `curl` it already stubs) as a shell
      function in its `BASH_ENV` file, implementing exactly the invocations the script
      makes and failing loudly on any other -- never a `pytest.skip` on the missing tool,
      which is a loosened ratchet (`a-ratchet-may-only-tighten`); probe the host through
      the bash the script will run under, not `shutil.which`, and prefer the real binary
      where that bash has one
- [ ] A leaked child whose spawning thread is a NAMED pool reaper (`mc-*-reaper`) is the
      shared `executors` pool warming, not the test's child: the fix is at the pool (a
      `shutdown` that joins its reaper BEFORE the kill loop, so a tick past its stop check
      cannot refill the slot it just emptied) and at session end
      (`shutdown_maintenance_executor()` in a `test/conftest.py` fixture), never a reap in
      the first test that happened to trigger it
- [ ] Two writers creating one sidecar on a fresh directory open it `O_CREAT | O_EXCL` first
      and reopen without `O_CREAT` on `FileExistsError`: a nonexclusive `O_CREAT` can lose
      the create race on Darwin with a bare `ENOENT` for the leaf, and a `prune` or flush
      that swallows it silently skips its work (`_open_lock_sidecar`)
- [ ] A test double's pid (`4242`) is a shared name across hundreds of files, so any
      process-wide table keyed by pid (`runtime_ownership`'s leases and tenancy) is reset on
      BOTH sides of every test by a `test/conftest.py` autouse fixture; a kill-gate assertion
      that reads `refused` where it expects the failed-kill wording is a neighbour's lease,
      not the gate
- [ ] A race detector never parks on a `threading.Barrier(..., timeout=)` a correct
      interleaving cannot reach: the correct code then pays the whole timeout every run and
      pass is told from fail by elapsed time. Park on an `Event`, signal the arrival you are
      waiting for through the seam under test, and assert the event count while parked
- [ ] `monkeypatch.chdir` does not put a `cwd` on the spawn: the descriptor still says
      `cwd=None`, indistinguishable to a per-spawn audit from a spawn in the checkout. Pin the
      helper's seam instead -- `runner=partial(subprocess.run, cwd=...)`, or the script
      module's `subprocess` binding replaced with a namespace whose `run` carries `cwd`
- [ ] An object whose constructor opens SQLite (`SubagentManager` -> `tasks.db`,
      `KnowledgeStore` per thread, `SkillsLoader` -> the skill index) is closed through its
      production close path at teardown -- `test/conftest.py`'s `close_subagent_managers` /
      `close_skills_loaders` opt-in fixtures, `opened(...)`, or `_close_all_for_tests()` when
      ANOTHER thread held a connection (`close()` is per-thread) -- never left to the cyclic
      collector, whose timing is what makes the descriptor count flap between runs
