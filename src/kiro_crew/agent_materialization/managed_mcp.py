#
# Delegating rather than restating is the point. This function exists so the

# reachable case is KIROCREW_CLI, which mcp_cron._caller_is_cli() reads as
# "skip per-session ownership entirely".
# env.py states the reviewable property instead: a config cannot author our
# namespace. KIROCREW_HOME is stripped by that same namespace rule and then
# re-pinned below to the gateway's actual override, so ours is the only value
# that can reach the child.


# Env keys that decide where ``Path.home()`` points, and therefore where a
# managed shim resolves its data home when no ``KIROCREW_HOME`` pin is present.
# Stripped from a MANAGED entry only -- this is not a deny rule for specs in
# general, and env.sanitize_spec_env deliberately lets ``HOME`` through because a
# user's own MCP server legitimately needs it.
#
# The population is what makes stripping correct here. A managed server is ours:
# its command and args are ours, and it resolves OUR data home through
# config_dir() -> Path.home(). On a default install that inheritance is exactly
# right, which is why _managed_mcp_env() emits nothing there. Letting a
# config-declared HOME override it would relocate the shim's whole data home:
# cron_add would report success into a store the gateway never reads and the job
# would never run -- the same silent split _managed_mcp_env documents, arriving
# through a door that only opened once user env survived a clean rebuild.
#
# Both spellings are listed because Path.home() consults HOME on POSIX and
# USERPROFILE on Windows, and a spec is portable across both.
#
# Held upper-cased and compared against key.upper(), because sanitize_spec_env
# preserves each key's ORIGINAL case (out[key] = value) -- so a spec declaring
# "userprofile" arrives with that spelling and an exact-case pop would miss it
# while Windows, whose env names are case-insensitive, would still honour it.
