"""Follow-up turn additions and the user's own turn text.

After the first turn ``build_message`` injects no transcript -- the ACP session
carries its history natively -- so what a later turn adds is the rail a turn needs
on its own: what comes back after a compaction, the Slack thread context, the
project, board, resource and folder lines, the interaction guidance, and the user's
text with quick prompts expanded, forged boundaries scrubbed and the user's span
mapped through both. Every untrusted value is screened or scrubbed here before it
lands beside a trusted frame.

The member section, the rules gate and the lifecycle verdict that decides both stay
at the ``members.member_turn_context`` chokepoint in :mod:`kiro_crew.context`, as do
the trigger-matched skill bodies and the request boundary itself.

New per-turn blocks belong here.
