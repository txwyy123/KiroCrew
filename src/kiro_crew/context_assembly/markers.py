"""Marker and fence neutralization for untrusted prompt text.

Every untrusted payload the context builder places beside a trusted frame -- memory,
lessons, transcript rows, channel text, folder names, skill bodies, member briefings
-- is scrubbed here first, so text an agent or a third party wrote cannot close a
block early or forge one of the boundaries the model treats as authoritative. The
genuine frames are minted by the callers, after these scrubs run.

Two scrubs stay defined on :mod:`kiro_crew.context` because callers rebind them
there: ``_neutralize_structural_markers`` and ``_member_marker_spans``. Code in this
module reads both through the facade at call time. The ``[BOARD]`` tag screen
(``_board_safe_tag_name``) stays there too, beside the grant grammar it admits by.

New marker families, fences and normalizations belong here.
