"""The diagnostic recorder — persists what today exists only in memory.

The gateway already measures itself. The adaptive controller samples host memory,
RSS, fds and loop lag every five seconds into
``AdaptiveController._samples``, a 60-entry ring; ``resource_status.probe`` reads
the memory posture on demand; ``stall_enrichment`` captures sockets once the loop
has already wedged. None of it survives the moment it was taken. So when a file
went to zero bytes at 21:50:44, nobody could say what the host or the gateway
were doing at that second — not because the data was hard to collect, but because
nothing wrote it down.

This module writes it down. One JSON line every
``KIROCREW_DIAG_SAMPLE_SECS`` (default 30) to
``<config_dir>/diag/snapshots-YYYYMMDD.jsonl``, kept for
``KIROCREW_DIAG_RETAIN_DAYS`` (default 7). About 2880 rows and ~1.7 MB a day.
On by default, because a recorder that has to be switched on before the incident
is a recorder that is off during every incident; ``KIROCREW_DIAG_RECORDER=0``
turns it off.

Three rules shape the implementation, each paid for by something that has
already gone wrong in this codebase:

* **The periodic path spawns nothing and reads no bytes it does not need.** No
  ``psutil`` (not in the venv), no subprocess (the rule
  :mod:`kiro_crew.dashboard.stall_enrichment` follows — forking from a sick
  process is riskier than reading procfs), and watched config files are read as
  ``stat`` metadata only, never opened. ``.env`` and the vault are never read.
* **Sampling happens off the event loop.** Every sample runs through
  ``asyncio.to_thread``. A diagnostic that adds loop lag would corrupt the
  loop-lag figure it reports, and on a busy host it would trip the very watchdog
  it exists to explain.
* **It is bounded, and it says when it backed off.** A sample must cost under
  20 ms; three consecutive samples over 200 ms drop the cadence to 60 s with one
  WARNING. The per-row ``cost_ms`` makes that visible rather than something a
  reader has to infer from gaps in the series.

What the recorder measures itself is the host and its own process. Everything
that needs gateway state — open sessions, live loops, subagent counts, the
adaptive cap, SEL rows in the window — arrives through
:meth:`Recorder.register_source`, registered by the boot wiring. That keeps this
module free of dashboard imports (it starts on the boot path, where an import
cycle is fatal) and lets a test drive a full sample with no gateway at all. The
process-family roster plugs into the same hook.
