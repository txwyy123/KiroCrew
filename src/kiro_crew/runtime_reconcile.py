"""Reconcile the kernel's process list against the runtime ownership registry.

Every other sweep in this gateway asks one question -- "is this pid one I still
need?" -- and asks it of a record. This one asks the kernel instead, and compares
the two answers in BOTH directions, because each direction is a different leak:

alive but unowned
    A process runs inside this install's own agent slice and no record claims it.
    Nothing is ever going to end it: the sweeps that could are driven by the very
    records it is missing from, so it survives every pass and every gateway
    restart. Measured on a live instance: 20 such processes at rest, 57-97 under
    load.

owned but dead
    A record names a pid that is gone, or one the kernel has given to an unrelated
    process. Whoever holds the lease is still waiting on a runtime that cannot
    answer, and the record keeps a pid number reserved against a process that will
    never be signalled. Measured on a live instance: 0 to 23 over fifteen minutes
    of ordinary use.

    The recycled pid belongs in this direction and not in the healthy one, which
    is what makes the reading a usable safety number: a record whose pid now
    names a stranger is the exact input that turns a sweep signalling by pid into
    a kill of somebody else's process. It is counted, its record is retracted,
    and the stranger itself is never signalled -- the record proves only that our
    process is gone, never that the current holder is ours.

The two counts are published as ``unowned_alive`` and ``owned_dead`` so an
operator sees a leak while it is small. They are the SLI; the actions below are
what makes a non-zero reading temporary rather than permanent.

Why an unowned process is not simply killed
------------------------------------------
Absence from the record is evidence that something is unclaimed, NOT evidence
that it is abandoned. The unowned population on a healthy host is dominated by
processes with perfectly good owners that no *session* record describes: a
Playwright chromium tree owned by a browser panel, ``mcp start-server``
processes owned by a stub connection, sandbox shim wrappers owned by the spawn
in progress. Killing on first sight would take a user's live browser out from
under them and call it a leak fixed.

So a kill needs five independent things to line up, and any one of them missing
leaves the process alone and merely counted:

1. the process carries this install's own spawn marker, so it is ours to end;
2. it was unowned on the PREVIOUS pass too, which is what distinguishes an
   abandoned process from one whose record is a few milliseconds behind its
   spawn -- the window every registration has;
3. it is older than :data:`DEFAULT_MIN_AGE_SECS`, for the same window seen from
   the other side;
4. its argv names a harness this gateway manages, which is the kill seam's own
   recycle guard asked HERE, at the decision point, rather than only inside the
   seam. A sandbox shim, an ``mcp start-server`` broker and a sibling install's
   python interpreter all reach this point carrying our inherited marker, and the
   seam declines every one of them -- a shim for what it WRAPS, not for being a shim:
   Crew's Linux namespace launcher is the pid a real agent runtime is tracked under, so
   the gate steps over it and asks the wrapped argv, which answers "harness" for
   ``kiro-cli`` and "not a harness" for an MCP probe or an app backend. Asked here, they
   are withheld by name; asked
   only inside the seam, each one first collects an ownership-gate allow and the
   kill attribution that allow writes -- 3151 attribution lines for 181 pids
   against 4 real kills, measured over 6.5 hours on one host;
5. :func:`~kiro_crew.runtime_ownership.authorize_runtime_kill` allows it, so a
   pid that turns out to be leased after all is refused at the last moment and
   the refusal is logged.

A pass also spends at most :data:`DEFAULT_MAX_KILLS` kills, so a reconciler that
is wrong about a whole population is wrong slowly enough to be noticed.

Why the budget can be turned down to zero
-----------------------------------------
``session.reconcile_max_kills`` bounds the kills one pass may perform, and its
ceiling is :data:`DEFAULT_MAX_KILLS` -- so it can only ever lower the shipped
budget, never raise it. At 0 the kill arm OBSERVES: the four local conditions are
still evaluated, a candidate that satisfies them all is audited as ``would_kill``,
published in :attr:`ReconcileReading.would_kill`, and never signalled. Nothing
above the budget check changes, so the leak reading an operator acts on is the
same reading either way.

An operator needs that setting because the evidence of abandonment here is "no
record on this data home claims this pid", and that evidence is only as wide as
the records THIS process can read. The agent slice is named from a hash of the
config directory, so every install sharing a data home shares the slice -- and a
runtime owned by a different process (a sibling gateway built from another
checkout, a long-lived CLI) is claimed by records that process holds. Its pid-file
row is the one thing bridging the two, and a row that was never written reads here
as an abandoned process carrying our marker. On such a host the unowned population
ran 250-504 per pass against 4 genuine strays in 6.5 hours.

Membership is narrower than the slice even for this install's own spawns, and one
such spawn answers by identity rather than by a record. A sandboxed tool subprocess
-- a build, an ``npx`` install, a provisioning run routed through
:func:`sandbox.sandboxed_spawn_argv` -- lands in this slice carrying our inherited
marker and is in no membership source, so it would read as unowned on every pass and
its argv0 basename would be all that stood between it and a signal once it outlives
the age floor. The chokepoint stamps ``KIROCREW_SANDBOX_TOOL`` on its whole tree and
:func:`process_is_sandbox_tool` reads that back, which takes such a tree out of the
candidate population on exec-time evidence -- paired with the managed-argv test,
because the marker is inherited and a harness that ends up inside a tool tree must
stay a candidate. An app backend's pid record is the other narrowing. Turning the
budget to 0 is how an operator on a shared-data-home host takes the reading without
the signal.

Why the dead direction acts immediately
---------------------------------------
Forgetting a dead pid harms nothing -- the process is already gone -- and the
lease holder learns its runtime died instead of waiting out a timeout. The same
two-pass confirmation is therefore not needed here, and a single liveness probe
that says DEAD is not enough on its own: an unsignalable pid is an unknown, not
an absence, and is left alone.

The three population names are the ones ``test/e2e/process_inventory.py`` uses
for the same reconciliation read from outside the process, and they classify the
recycled pid the same way, so a reading published here and an inventory taken by
that harness describe one host state in one vocabulary.

    because a pid can change hands between this answer and that signal.

    What asking it HERE changes is who gets recorded. The unowned population is
    dominated by processes that carry our inherited spawn marker and are not
    harnesses at all -- a Playwright chromium tree, an ``mcp start-server`` broker, a
    sandbox shim around something that is not a runtime, another install's python

    namespace launcher and asks the wrapped argv, because on Linux that launcher is the
    pid an agent runtime is tracked under.) Every one of them satisfies
    the other four local conditions, so without this one each would collect an
    ownership-gate allow and have the gate write a kill attribution naming a process
    the seam declines to touch.
    The gate's allow log is the record a maintainer reads to answer "did we signal
    somebody else's process", and at that volume it cannot answer.

    Answers from argv, so it says a pid is the KIND of process we manage and never
    that it is a particular one. That is why it is a condition and not an

    module reads, carries the inherited spawn marker, and is recorded nowhere, so the
    argv0 basename test is all that holds it back from a signal once it is older than
    the age floor. The chokepoint stamps ``KIROCREW_SANDBOX_TOOL`` on the whole tree,
    so this answers for a descendant no spawn recorded, and it answers out of the
    kernel's exec-time copy: a same-uid process can set its own argv or write any
    file, and cannot alter a running process's environment. That is the difference
    between a name and evidence.

    The marker means TOOL, not OWNERSHIP, which is why it is a separate variable from
    the one :func:`process_is_ours` reads. That one enables a kill and this one
    withholds it, so the two must be able to disagree.

    FAILS OPEN, the opposite of every other test here, because its answer is an extra

    environment and a platform with no environ oracle both leave *pid* in the
    candidate population, where the ownership, argv, two-pass and age conditions
    still govern it. Failing closed would widen what escapes those conditions on
    doubt, which is the one thing this module must never do.

    This answer alone NEVER excludes a pid, because the marker describes a TREE. The
    chokepoint accepts harness argv by design -- its ``is_kiro_cli`` parameter exists
    so a delegating spawn can route through it, and a pod child probe and an
    unattended fix-authoring agent both do -- and the marker is inherited, so a
    harness can carry it without being tool work.

        A record's SOURCE decides which remover can retract it, and no remover
        reports whether a row matched -- each returns whether its rewrite of the file
        succeeded, which an unchanged rewrite also does. So the answer here is an
        OBSERVED disappearance: the row was present in that source before and is
        absent from it after. Anything weaker reports retractions that did not
        happen, on every pass, for as long as the record survives.

        Membership is wider than the session file, so the session untracker alone
        cannot retract most of it. A descendant tracked only in ``kiro_pids.txt``
        (this gateway's namespace-sandbox children are all filed there, because the
        pid that is tracked and leased is the launcher parent) has no session row at
        all, and rewriting the session file leaves its record exactly where it was.

        Two sources are deliberately not retracted, and that is why the answer is
        three-valued rather than a bool. A session row owned by a concurrent CLI or a
        predecessor gateway is a real dead record, but ``_untrack_session_pid``
        matches on the CALLING process's prefix and cannot remove anybody else's row
        -- those are the next gateway start's to clear, once its owner reads dead.
        And a pid known only to the MCP backend pidfile or to the manager's
        in-memory union has no row in either tracking file: the MCP sweep owns the
        first and the manager owns the second. Both answer ``"not-mine"`` FOREVER, by
        design, so folding them into the same ``False`` a real failure gets would
        publish one WARNING per stale pid per cleanup tick for the gateway's life --
        a steady state reported as a fault. ``"failed"`` is reserved for a retraction
        that was this pass's to make and did not land, which is the only one worth
        waking anybody for.

        The descendant retraction removes the ROWS this pass captured, never every
        row sharing the pid. A pid is reused, so a replacement descendant can have
        appended its own row under the same number since the snapshot; taking that
        row out would leave a live process tracked nowhere, which is the leak this
        file exists to prevent. Success is likewise the captured rows being ABSENT
        on a fresh read, not the remover's answer -- a replacement keeps the pid
