      // staleTime: Infinity on this query:
      //   1. A `slots` frame fires on routine session activity, so a frame
      //      landing inside an in-flight folder mutation's optimistic window
      //      (collapse / reorder / rename / move) would overwrite the
      //      optimistic cache value with backend state via a direct
      //      setQueryData — which the mutation's cancelQueries cannot cancel
      //      — snapping the folder back to its pre-action state until
      //      onSettled refetches.
      //   2. The WS payload omits per-folder `history_count` (the backend
      //      computes it via a synchronous session scan that must not run on
      //      this hot path). Seeding count-less data marks the query fresh,
      //      so a mount-time query would skip GET /api/chat/folders and the
      //      counts (the "hide when empty" filter's input) would never load.
      // So seed the tree once, then invalidate to let the HTTP GET backfill
      // counts; after the cache is populated, live frames leave it alone and
      // folder create/rename/move propagate through their own mutation +
      // invalidate path as before.
      //
      // Guard on `existing === undefined` (cache NEVER populated), NOT on
      // `!existing || length === 0`: a user with genuinely zero folders has
      // the HTTP GET cache the empty array `[]`, and `[].length === 0` would
      // then re-match on EVERY subsequent slots frame — re-seeding `[]` and
      // re-invalidating in a loop, hammering the session-scanning
      // GET /api/chat/folders. `undefined` fires exactly once, on first paint.
