 *  `clearSubagentsForSnapshot` keeps only `pending` entries across a reconnect,
 *  so every agent already running at that moment has its entry discarded while
 *  its remaining frames are all incremental ones.
 *
 *  A created entry is deliberately a MINIMUM: the frame that reaches here
 *  carries no task text or agent name, so those stay empty and a later frame
 *  that does carry them (`subagent_done`, a snapshot replay) fills them in. A
 *  card reading "running, last tool X" with no title is worth more to the
 *  operator than no card at all, which is the alternative.
 *
 *  Guards mirror the lifecycle reducers exactly, because this one WRITES:
 *  `isUnsafeKey` refuses a poisoned slot or id outright, and `safeKey` reroutes
 *  one to an inert own-property if it ever slips past. A hostile
 *  `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype` id therefore creates nothing and
