# RFC: Overload resilience — durable task queue, admission before allocation, adaptive concurrency, layered recovery

- Status: implemented on main in [#10521](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/pull/10521).
  The shipped contracts are [`../system-specs/modules/taskq.md`](../system-specs/modules/taskq.md),
  [`../system-specs/modules/adaptive-concurrency.md`](../system-specs/modules/adaptive-concurrency.md),
  and the linked module specifications they reference. The durable task store,
  admission and host budgets, session-start collection, adaptive controller,
  recovery and wait states, TaskRunner/workflow adapters, API, and dashboard
  surface all shipped in that PR. The dedicated-runtime parent checkpoint-pause
  remains explicitly excluded by decision Q3. The delivery plan below is retained
  as the historical pre-merge record.
- Author: bolichen (Bolin Chen). Requirements: the 2026-09-12 spec
  (`overload-resilience/SPEC.md` in the crew workspace); code investigation
  `subagents/081a6e0a`; GPT-6 review `subagents/99cae534` (verdict REDESIGN, its
  must-fix list is folded into §4, §7 and §9).
- Audited against main `6f056722b`. `origin/main` had not moved when this document
  was written.
- Related: [rfc-durable-run-coordinator.md](rfc-durable-run-coordinator.md) (the
  subagent-only SQLite ledger this RFC generalises across entry points — see §13),

Line numbers below are written as `L<n>` beside a symbol name and are exact at
`6f056722b`; the symbol is the durable citation, the line is the audit trail.

## 1. Problem and evidence

One goal: accept an unbounded number of tasks, execute a bounded number, keep the
rest as cheap durable rows, shrink concurrency when the host or a provider hurts,
recover from transient failures without a human restarting the Gateway, and never
leave a task showing `running` forever.

Every row of SPEC §一 was re-verified on main. "已复现" means the behaviour was
observed in the incident logs or reproduced by the research harness; "待验证" means
it is read from code and still needs a fault-injected run.

`mcp_gateway.max_backends` (`config/sections.py` L4778) defaults to **64** on
main. The 20 seen in incident machines was an explicit local pin and is not a
baseline value.

Nothing bounds **total processes** or **in-flight spawn+initialize** across the
daemon; nothing bounds **total active executions** across entry points. The
per-entry semaphores compose as sums and products, so "each entry has a limit"
proves nothing about the host.

## 3. Task model

### 3.1 One durable store: `$KIROCREW_HOME/tasks/tasks.db`

Decision: introduce one SQLite store owned by a new package `kiro_crew/taskq/`
(`store.py`, `state.py`, `scheduler.py`, `budget.py`, `controller.py`,
`recovery.py`). TaskRunner `runs.json`, the workflow `RunRegistry`, and subagent
`state.json`/`tombstone.json`/`result.txt` folders stay as **artifact and
evidence stores**, referenced by `result_ref`; they are not the scheduling source
of truth. Rationale: the three existing stores carry three incompatible lifecycle
vocabularies (`paused`, `interrupted`, tombstone classes) and none can express a
cross-entry budget or a lease. WAL mode, `synchronous=NORMAL`, single writer task
in the gateway process, reads from any task. No external service.

### 3.2 Schema (SPEC §二.1 fields)

```sql
CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,            -- stable; the subagent id / run id / workflow agent id
  parent_id TEXT,                 -- parent task (subagent parent, workflow run, TaskRunner run)
  root_id TEXT NOT NULL,          -- top of the tree, for fairness lanes
  session_key TEXT NOT NULL,      -- owning session (lane key); "" for cron/hook roots
  kind TEXT NOT NULL,             -- subagent | workflow_agent | taskrunner_step | chat_turn | cron | hook
  harness TEXT NOT NULL,          -- acp backend id (ACP_BACKEND_KIRO ...), never a model id
  provider TEXT,                  -- provider lane for per-provider throttling
  params_json TEXT NOT NULL,      -- full spawn kwargs (the dict shape _queue entries carry today)
  workspace TEXT,
  scope_ref TEXT NOT NULL,        -- {memory_store, allowed_tools, approval_scope, app_owner} reference
  state TEXT NOT NULL,            -- §3.3 vocabulary
  attempts INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  next_run_at REAL,               -- for retry_wait; NULL = eligible now
  lease_owner TEXT,               -- gateway incarnation id
  lease_expires_at REAL,
  generation INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  progress_json TEXT,             -- last progress marker, ts, completed steps
  result_ref TEXT,                -- path/URI of result.txt, run folder, workflow result
  deadline_at REAL,               -- optional caller total deadline
  idempotency_key TEXT,           -- caller-supplied; UNIQUE when present
  created_at REAL NOT NULL, updated_at REAL NOT NULL
);
CREATE INDEX tasks_dispatch ON tasks(state, next_run_at, root_id);
CREATE TABLE task_events (task_id TEXT, seq INTEGER, ts REAL, kind TEXT, data_json TEXT,
  PRIMARY KEY(task_id, seq));
CREATE TABLE meta (key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT);  -- schema_version, incarnation
```

`task_events` is append-only and is the source for §10 "recent progress" and
"retry count"; it uses the envelope shape of `kiro_crew.events` so it can later be
projected into the append-only ledger without a second writer.

### 3.3 State machine

  └──── retry_wait ◀───────────────────┘                                  │     (approval pending)
        (next_run_at)                                                     ├─▶ recovering
                                                                          │     (transport/runtime rebuild)
 terminal: done | failed | cancelled | unknown_side_effect                └─▶ terminal
```

| State | Meaning | Budgets running (§8) | Holds |
|---|---|---|---|
| `queued` | durable row, no resources | queue wait only | nothing |
| `admitted` | claimed by scheduler, lane slot + host budget reserved | start | slot, budget |
| `starting` | session-start gate held, `session/new` outstanding | start | slot, budget, start gate |
| `running` | ≥1 stream event seen | execution, no-progress | slot, budget |
| `waiting_children` | parent blocked in `spawn_sub_agents` | total deadline only | budget (residency), NOT slot |
| `waiting_permission` | approval pending (§14 W5) | total deadline only | budget (residency), NOT slot |
| `waiting_input` | tool or command needs real user input (§14 W4) | total deadline only | budget (residency), NOT slot |
| `waiting_dependency` | external dependency unavailable or rate-limited; wake by `DependencySignal` or `retry_at` (§14 W2) | recovery wait | budget (residency) while the runtime is kept, else nothing |
| `waiting_infra` | admission deferred (memory posture, gate closed, dependency down) | recovery wait | nothing new |
| `retry_wait` | transient failure, `next_run_at` set | recovery wait | nothing |
| `recovering` | transport/runtime being rebuilt for this task | recovery wait | slot, budget |
| `done` / `failed` / `cancelled` | terminal (`done` is the addendum's `succeeded`; it may carry `partial=true`) | — | — |
| `unknown_side_effect` | terminal-pending: an external operation may have happened, reconcile needed (§9) | — | — |

Every `waiting_*` and `retry_wait` row carries a `WaitRecord` (§14.1). Terminal
states never regress. `cancelled` beats every other transition
(§9.5). Existing readers map: subagent `tombstone.json` classes → `done`/`failed`/`cancelled`;
TaskRunner `paused` after crash → `retry_wait` with `attempts+1`; workflow
`interrupted` → `retry_wait` when the run's remaining agents are re-dispatchable,
else `failed`.

### 3.4 Write-before-ack

`spawn_run`, `spawn_sub_agents`, `task_run`, `workflow_run`, cron and hook
dispatch each call `TaskStore.accept(batch)` and receive ids only after
`COMMIT`. A failed write (disk full, locked >2s, schema mismatch) raises
`TaskStoreUnavailable`, which the MCP tool surfaces as a typed refusal — never an
accepted id. Items are stored one row each; no batch summarisation. The memory
posture check (`cached_admission_check`) moves from before-queue to
before-`admitted`: pressure defers, it no longer refuses (GPT-6 must-fix 5).
Approval, deny-rule and governance checks stay where they are (before accept).

### 3.5 Bounded dispatch window

The scheduler keeps at most `agent.task_dispatch_window` (default 64) rows in
memory: the `admitted`/`starting`/`running` set plus a prefetch of eligible
`queued` rows ordered by the fairness policy (§6). 2000 accepted tasks are 2000
rows and ~64 Python objects.

### 3.6 Compatibility with existing records

On first start with the store enabled, `taskq.migrate` imports: non-tombstoned subagent
folders (today's orphan recovery input) → `retry_wait` or `failed` per the
existing PID/result inference; TaskRunner `runs.json` `paused`/`planned` runs →
`queued` only when `taskrunner.auto_resume` (new, default false) is set, else
left as today; workflow `RunRegistry` running → `retry_wait` only for runs whose
plan is replayable from cached results (`workflow_rerun_subtree` semantics),
else `failed` as today. The import is idempotent (keyed on id) and runs before
the scheduler starts. Old files are not deleted; `result_ref` points at them.

## 4. Admission before allocation

### 4.1 One host budget

`HostBudget` (gateway process, `taskq/budget.py`) holds three counters with
ceilings: `procs` (expected OS processes), `rss_mb`, `fds`. Ceilings derive from
`compute_max_subagents`' inputs (`subagent_memory_mb`, available memory, CPU) and
from `resource.getrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE)` via `platform_compat`. Every executor
charges an **estimate** at `admitted` and true-ups from the periodic `resource_status`
sample: a shared-runtime session costs (0 procs, `session_rss_mb`, k fds); a
dedicated runtime costs (1 + expected stub count, `runtime_rss_mb`, ...); each
gatewayd backend the session will need costs (1, `backend_rss_mb`, 3). Pooled,
exclusive and fallback backends charge identically — exclusivity is a topology
property, not a budget exemption. Idle resident sessions are charged until the
existing idle reclaim (`session.timeout_secs`) releases them; the budget reads
the reclaim, it does not add one.

### 4.2 gatewayd global spawn gate and `queued` keepalive

`mcp_gateway/admission.py` `SpawnGate` (daemon-wide, single instance built in
`run_gatewayd` beside `BackendPool`): AIMD capacity with `initial/min/max` =
`4/1/8`, FIFO deque of waiters, `Permit` with idempotent `settle(outcome)` and
`release()` as **separate** operations (GPT-6 hazard 5). Acquisition happens
inside the `_spawn` closure of `_acquire_backend`, AFTER the per-key
`_spawn_locks` dedup and AFTER `CircuitBreaker.allow` (never hold a permit during
breaker cooldown, never hold `pool._lock` while queued). Resident capacity is
checked BEFORE the permit is taken: `BackendPool.reserve()` (new) decrements a
resident slot or raises `PoolAtCapacity` before `spawn()`, replacing the
post-spawn `add()` check (GPT-6 must-fix 4).

Permit lifecycle: the permit covers spawn **and** the active `initialize`
window. Because `ready` is sent before `initialize` arrives (the stub forwards
kiro-cli's first frame), the permit is released by whichever comes first:
`_init_done_event` **plus** the process being reaped, or `initialize_timeout_secs`
after `ready` when no `initialize` was forwarded (counted as **neutral**, not
failure — an unused prewarm or a client that never initialised is not
congestion). A backend killed for init timeout stays charged to `HostBudget`
until `Backend.shutdown` confirms the process is gone (the SIGKILL-survivor case).

Protocol: `REGISTERED_CAPABILITIES` gains `"spawn_queue"`. A stub that
advertises it sends `{"type":"ensure_backend","wait_budget_secs":N}`; the daemon
then emits `{"type":"queued","position":p,"capacity":c,"eta_secs":e}` every 5s
while waiting. A stub without the capability never sees `queued`: it gets the
≤25s legacy behaviour, so old stubs keep working during a rolling upgrade. The
stub's wait is a **silence timer** (reset on `queued`, `keepalive`, `pong`),
bounded by the 600s total budget; those control frames are consumed, never
forwarded to kiro-cli. Bridge pings continue to be answered from the connection's
read loop while a spawn waits, by moving the wait off the sequential reader into
a per-connection task (GPT-6 hazard 8). The same negotiation applies to
`_reconnect` (`stub.py`) and to `_respawn_backend_for_stub`, so all three stub
paths are queue-aware (GPT-6 must-fix 3). Daemon drain closes the gate first,
cancels queued futures and watcher tasks, then proceeds with today's teardown.

### 4.3 Fallback classification

`rejected` frames carry `class`: `capacity`, `pressure`, `compat`, `isolation`,
`breaker`. The stub runs `fallback_exec` only for `compat` (target cannot be
pooled) and `isolation` (declared private topology that the daemon refuses);
`capacity`/`pressure`/`breaker` surface as a JSON-RPC error to kiro-cli with
`retry_after_secs`, and the owning task moves to `waiting_infra` (§7). An
`isolation` fallback still charges `HostBudget` through the stub's
`fallback_exec` report on its registration line, so it is admitted, not free.
Old daemons emit no `class`; a new stub treats a missing `class` as `compat`
(today's behaviour) — the compatibility floor cannot provide the new guarantee
and the RFC does not claim it does.

The mirror direction is where the guarantee has a price, and it is paid rather
than waived: an old STUB cannot act on `class` either, so `fallback: true` is the
only thing it would read, and giving it to a `capacity` refusal hands the
unbounded exec back at exactly the moment the host cannot carry it — worse than
untagged, because that stub closes its socket before exec'ing, so the
`HostBudget` charge is released before the process exists and N concurrent
refusals escape accounting entirely. `capacity` therefore carries no `fallback`
on any wire shape, and an old stub that is still waiting takes its terminal exit:
kiro-cli reports that one server as failed for that one session, recorded as a
`terminal:` line in `stub_fallback.jsonl`. A refusal that arrives after the
pre-upgrade stub's own 25 s pre-flight window is exec'd anyway on a path that
reads no frame — see [mcp.md](../architecture/mcp.md) for the bound that keeps the
daemon inside it and the residual that survives. Losing one session's tool surface is accepted to keep the
host bound; `compat`/`isolation` keep the tag, so a target-shaped refusal still
degrades to a per-session exec on every stub version.

### 4.4 Session-start gate with tracked ownership

`SessionStartGate` (gateway process, `taskq/scheduler.py`): fixed semaphore
`agent.session_start_concurrency` (default 2, separate from
`_COLD_START_MAX_CONCURRENT`, which stays for runtime spawn+`initialize`).
Acquired after `HostBudget`, before `AcpRuntime.create_session`. The gate is
**not** adaptive — the adaptive loop is the gatewayd `SpawnGate` plus the
execution-cap controller (§5); two adapting loops on the same resource oscillate
(GPT-6 §5).

Ownership: a start attempt is `task_events(kind="start_attempt", data={gen,
session_key?})` written before `session/new` is sent. On `AcpRequestTimeout` the
task does **not** re-queue. It moves to `recovering`; the attempt stays owned by
a detached `StartCollector` that keeps the `req_id` registered
(`_pending_requests` must expose `adopt(req_id)` rather than `pop`) and either
(a) receives the late `session/new` result — then the collector closes that
session through the runtime's normal session teardown unless the task is still
in `recovering` with no newer attempt, in which case the session is adopted and
the task resumes `starting` under the same generation; or (b) observes the
runtime die, and releases the budget. No second `session/new` is issued for the
task until the collector settles or a `start_collect_timeout_secs` (default 300)
cleanup deadline passes, after which the attempt is recorded `abandoned` and the
task goes to `retry_wait` with backoff. A `session/new` timeout **never** falls
back to a dedicated process for congestion; the dedicated path remains only for
explicit `model`/`allowed_tools`/privacy overrides, and it goes through the same
gate and budget.

### 4.5 Acquisition order and deadlock argument

Order, always: (1) `TaskStore.claim` (lease) → (2) lane execution slot
(`SubagentManager._max_concurrent` or the entry's counterpart, via the shared
`ExecutionCap`) → (3) `HostBudget.reserve` → (4) `SessionStartGate` → (5)
gatewayd `SpawnGate` (in the daemon, per backend, after `_spawn_locks` and
breaker) → (6) `BackendPool.reserve`. Release strictly in reverse. Invariant: a
holder of resource k only ever waits for resource k+1, so the wait-for graph is
acyclic. Waits at steps 2–4 are bounded by `admit_wait_secs` (default 30); on
expiry the task returns to `queued` releasing everything, so a stuck downstream
never pins upstream slots. Prewarm (`prewarm_from_payloads`) is a step-5 client
with priority BELOW every stub: it is skipped entirely while the controller is in
`pressure` or `paused` (GPT-6 hazard 3). Exclusive backends take steps 5–6 like
pooled ones; step 6 for them decrements a separate `exclusive_reserved` counter so
they remain exclusive but counted.

### 4.6 Release paths

Every reservation is released exactly once by a `ReservationSet` whose
`release()` is idempotent and is called from: normal completion; `cancel_impl`
(after `_schedule_cancel_recovery_impl` finishes teardown — today's ordering in
`cancellation.py` is kept); any exception in `_run_impl`; `StartCollector`
settlement for late callbacks; lease expiry detected by the reconciler (the
lease owner is the same process, so this is a self-check on crashed tasks); and
gateway shutdown (release-all, rows stay `admitted`/`starting` and are reset to
`queued` by the incarnation check on next boot).

## 5. Adaptive controller

### 5.1 Signals

Sampled every `controller_sample_secs` (5s) into a ring of 60:

| Signal | Source | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| event-loop lag | `asyncio` heartbeat delta in gateway and in gatewayd (reported in the `stats` frame) | host |
| RSS / available memory | `resource_status._read_available_gb`, process RSS via `platform_compat` | host |
| fd / proc count | `HostBudget` true-up | host |
| start latency | `session/new` and backend `initialize` durations (p50/p95) | host |
| attributable timeout rate | `AcpRequestTimeout` on start, backend init timeout, stall — excludes permission/argument/context errors | host |
| provider 429 / throttle | typed provider errors surfaced by the ACP stream | per provider |
| completion rate | `done` per window vs `admitted` per window | host |

Classification (`errors.py` conventions): permission denied, invalid params,
context-length, deny-rule and governance refusals are `non_congestion` and never
feed the controller.

### 5.2 Two actuators, one policy object

`AdaptivePolicy` (shared dataclass, used by both loops):

| Parameter | gatewayd `SpawnGate` | gateway `ExecutionCap` |
|---|---|---|
| initial / floor / ceiling | 4 / 1 / 8 | `min(user_max, 4)` / 1 / `user_max` |
| decrease | ×0.5 floor 1 on **corroborated** pressure (host signal + ≥2 distinct keys slow/failing, or ENOMEM/EAGAIN) | ×0.5 floor 1 |
| increase | +1 after ≥20 successful inits AND ≥30s without pressure AND demand at the limit | ×2 per 5s clean window until this process meets corroborated pressure, then +1 per clean window; the success bar is `min(increase_successes, cap)` |
| cooldown after decrease | 30s; pre-decrease successes discarded | 60s |
| hysteresis | decrease at lag ≥ 250ms or mem ≤ `resource_critical_gb`; increase only below 100ms and ≥ `resource_pressure_gb` | same thresholds |
| pause | mem ≤ critical for 2 samples, or dependency (gatewayd/provider) down | stop admitting; keep running work |
| probe after pause | admit 1 task; require it to reach `running` before capacity returns to floor+1 | same |

The gateway actuator is `SubagentManager.apply_limits(cfg, max_concurrent=effective)`
(existing) plus equivalent hooks on `TaskRunner` and the workflow `WorkerPool`;
`effective ≤ user max` always, and `apply_limits` never writes `config.json` — the
user's value stays the ceiling. On a fresh gateway start `effective` begins at
`min(user_max, 4)` and earns its way up (no full concurrency until work completes).
Per-provider 429s multiply only that provider's lane share (§6), never the host
cap.

Thresholds above are starting values; the in-repo fault-injection harness (§11,
wave E) fixes them and the spec records the measured numbers.

The `ExecutionCap` increase rule and the `subagent_spawn_stagger_secs` default in
the tables above are the **recorded defaults**, replacing the `+1` per 60s clean
window and the `2.0s` stagger this RFC first proposed. Both were changed because
the original pair could not reach a user's configured ceiling: a ×0.5 decrease
fires on one lag spike while a flat 20-success bar at cap 1 needs twenty serial
runs to earn cap 2, and a 2.0s stagger takes over two minutes to fill 64 slots
even once the cap allows them. The climb is bounded by `user_max` alone, judged
against the live pressure signals in each sample; it is NOT clamped to a figure
predicted from past peak memory and CPU per agent. Such a prediction prices every
slot at the busiest agent's burst (one build-heavy run at 20 cores and 9 GB) and
pins a 32-core host with 96 GB free at the fresh-start cap for the life of the
process, under a controller that sees only clean samples -- the loop exists so
that many sessions can ask for many workers, be admitted up to the ceiling the
user chose, and queue on real pressure rather than be refused for a guess. Memory
over-commit is the one unrecoverable failure and is guarded live (the pressure
line gates increases, the critical line cuts, the spawn gate defers cold starts
that would breach `spawn_min_memory_gb` plus unobserved growth); CPU over-commit
only slows work, which is the pressure the loop already backs off from, so CPU
is not a sizing term for the auto ceiling either. Doubling is
one-way per process: the first corroborated pressure or pause retires it and the
controller stays in congestion avoidance for that process lifetime.

## 6. Fairness

- **Lanes.** One lane per `root_id`'s `session_key`. Within a lane, FIFO by
  `created_at` (preserves same-session ordering). Across lanes, deficit round
  robin with equal quantum, so a 2000-task batch from one session cannot starve
  a 3-task session; a lane with `retry_wait` rows only is skipped.
- **Reserved capacity.** `ExecutionCap` reserves 1 slot for interactive chat
  turns and never charges control-plane work (cancel, status, health, reconcile)
  against any budget; those paths read the store and the in-memory window only.
- **Parent waiting on children.** A parent entering `spawn_sub_agents` (or a
  workflow `parallel` barrier) transitions to `waiting_children` and **releases
  its execution slot** while keeping its residency charge (the kiro-cli process
  is idle in a tool call, but resident). Children are dispatched from the
  parent's lane with a `child_reserve` of 1 slot that only depth>0 tasks may
  take, so a fleet of parents can never hold every slot. If residency budget is
  exhausted by waiting parents, the scheduler applies checkpoint-pause: for a
  dedicated-runtime parent, close its runtime and mark the parent
  `waiting_children{resumable=true}`; on children completion the parent resumes
  via the existing continuable-session path (`spawn_continue` semantics). Shared-
  runtime parents cost a session handle, not a process, and are not paused. No
  counter is decremented without the corresponding resource actually being idle
  or released.

## 7. Recovery ladder

Shared `RecoveryPolicy`: exponential backoff base 2s, cap 120s, equal jitter,
per-layer attempt caps, escalation only when the lower layer exhausted its cap.
Each layer records `task_events(kind="recover", layer=...)`.

| Layer | Trigger | Cleanup deadline | Attempts before escalation | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| L1 tool call | JSON-RPC error classed `recoverable_infra` (backend gone, queued timeout) | — | 3 | re-issue the MCP call through the stub; task stays `running` |
| L2 backend | `BackendGone`, init timeout, breaker OPEN | `Backend.shutdown` budget (existing 10+5+2s) | 2 respawns per key | `_respawn_backend_for_stub` under `SpawnGate`; replay captured `initialize`, restore subscriptions; on capability change → L3 |
| L3 ACP runtime | `AcpRuntimeDead`, stall > `subagent_stall_idle_secs`, `session/new` collector abandoned | shutdown budget + process-tree kill via `platform_compat` | 2 | rebuild runtime, `session/load` the task's session if continuable else restart attempt with `generation+1`; task `recovering` |
| L4 gatewayd | supervisor: liveness ping fails 3× AND (loop lag from `stats` unavailable or > 5s) AND no backend progress for 60s | daemon drain | 1 per 10 min | respawn daemon; stubs reconnect within 600s; tasks whose stubs cannot reconnect → L3 |
| L5 gateway | none automatic | — | — | logged escalation event + `send_notification`; the user restarts. Automatic gateway restart is out of scope. |

Overload never enters the ladder: pressure pauses admission and lowers caps
(§5); only a unit that has stopped making progress **and** fails an independent
probe (ping for the daemon, `session/prompt` heartbeat for a runtime, `initialize`
replay for a backend) is terminated. Progress evidence outranks liveness evidence:
`is_serving=true`, a live PID or an open TCP socket alone never prevent
termination, and business progress alone (recent stream event) always prevents it.
L2 handles initialize-consumed-then-lost correctly: a stub with a captured
`initialize` re-primes the new backend; it never `fallback_exec`s an
uninitialised one (`respawn give-up (no captured initialize)` stays a give-up,
now classed `compat`).

## 8. Time budgets

| Budget | Runs during | Default | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| queue wait | `queued`, `waiting_infra`, `retry_wait` | unbounded unless `deadline_at`; a subagent spawn DEFERRED for memory (floor or posture) 1800s of parked time → `failed` "never started: waiting for memory" (Q10) | caller; `agent.subagent_queue_max_wait_secs` |
| admit wait | `admitted` waiting on steps 2–4 | 30s → back to `queued` | `agent.admit_wait_secs` |
| start | `starting`, active only | 90s | `session_start_timeout_secs` |
| start collect | `recovering` after start timeout | 300s | `agent.start_collect_timeout_secs` |
| execution | `running` | 10800s subagent, 14400s chat turn | existing keys; clock starts at first stream event, not at accept |
| no-progress | `running` | `subagent_stall_idle_secs` | existing |
| recovery wait | `recovering`, per layer | ladder caps (§7) | `RecoveryPolicy` |
| total deadline | all non-terminal | none | caller `deadline_at` |

The startup watchdog (`_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_SECS` 120, keyed on `_exec_started`) and
the wall-clock reaper in `monitoring.py` both read `started_at` from the store's
`running` transition, so queue and admit time never trigger them (GPT-6 §4).

`spawn_sub_agents` keeps its 60..7200s wait clamp. On expiry it returns
`{"status":"still_running","ids":[...],"states":{...},"poll":"spawn_status"}`;
the children keep their 10800s budget, are not cancelled, and their completion
events still arrive. A parent chat turn hitting `chat_turn_timeout_secs` leaves
its children in the store untouched; results are delivered to the parent session
by id when it next runs (§10).

## 9. Exactly-once boundaries

1. **Atomic claim.** `UPDATE tasks SET state='admitted', lease_owner=?,
   lease_expires_at=?, generation=generation+1 WHERE id=? AND state IN
   ('queued','retry_wait') AND (next_run_at IS NULL OR next_run_at<=?)`; zero
   rows affected means someone else has it.
2. **Lease.** 60s, renewed by the run loop every 20s; a lease that lapses in the
   same process is a bug surfaced by the reconciler, not a takeover.
3. **Generation fencing.** Every callback (`_claim_finalize`, `_release_slot`,
   stream events, `StartCollector`) carries the generation it started with; the
   store rejects writes whose generation is stale, so a late worker from
   generation n cannot overwrite n+1's result or release n+1's reservation.
4. **Stale results.** Rejected writes are appended to `task_events` as
   `stale_result` for diagnosis; the parent is never notified twice for one id
   (`settle_queued_delivery` ordering kept).
5. **Cancel vs restart.** `cancelled` is written first, then teardown. Recovery
   and dispatch re-read `state` after acquiring the lease and abort on
   `cancelled`. Restart never resurrects a cancelled row; a cancel arriving
   during `recovering` wins.
6. **Idempotency classes.** `params_json.side_effect_class ∈ {none,
   idempotent_key, unknown}`. `none` and `idempotent_key` retry freely
   (the key is forwarded); `unknown` on a lost response goes to
   `unknown_side_effect` and the reconciler asks the entry adapter to query
   (e.g. `gh api` for a PR the task was creating). No blind replay of send/pay/
   submit; no exactly-once promise for arbitrary external operations.
7. **Reconcile-first.** Boot: incarnation id changes → every `admitted`/
   `starting`/`running`/`recovering` row of the old incarnation is examined:
   result artifact present → `done`; tombstone → mapped terminal; else
   `retry_wait` (attempts+1) or `unknown_side_effect` per class.
8. **Auth re-validation.** At dispatch and at every recovery the adapter re-runs
   the checks that produced `scope_ref`: agent existence/ownership
   (`_agent_prevalidated` becomes "prevalidated at accept, revalidated at
   admit", so app spawns may queue), memory store binding, allowed tools,
   approval scope. Failure → `failed{reason=auth_stale}`, never a silent
   downgrade. TaskRunner's clearing of transient auto-approve on restart is kept;
   a persisted `auto_approve=true` is never restored.

## 10. Visibility

- **API.** `GET /api/tasks?state=&session=` (paged, from the store);
  `GET /api/tasks/{id}` with `task_events` tail; existing `spawn_list`,
  `spawn_status`, `/api/workflows/runs`, TaskRunner status map their vocabularies
  onto §3.3 via one `to_public_state()`.
- **UI.** Sub-agents panel and Workflows tab show `queued (position)`,
  `waiting: children / permission / infra`, `retry in Ns (attempt k)`,
  `recovering (layer)`; the resources popover shows effective concurrency vs user
  max and the current pressure reason.
- **Health.** `session_health.py` reads task + runtime state instead of scraping
  `gateway.log`; the regex path remains only as a fallback for pre-migration
  logs. `kirocrew doctor` prints queue depth, oldest wait, effective caps,
  pressure reason.
- **Metrics** (bounded cardinality; labels are enums, never ids):
  `taskq_depth{state}`, `taskq_oldest_wait_secs`, `taskq_completion_rate`,
  `taskq_effective_cap{lane_kind}`, `taskq_pressure_reason{reason}`,
  `host_procs_peak`, `host_fds_peak`, `host_rss_peak_mb`, `loop_lag_ms{process}`,
  `recovery_duration_secs{layer}`, `restarts_total{layer}`,
  `spawn_gate_capacity`, `spawn_gate_queued`, `spawn_gate_wait_p95_ms`.
  SEL audit rows `taskq.cap-decreased`, `taskq.paused`, `mcp-gateway.spawn-gate-halved`.

## 11. Test plan

Unit tests use a fake harness (`test/fake_pool_mcp_server.py`, a fake
`LLMProvider`, `freezegun`-style controlled clock via the existing monotonic
injection), never a real `kiro-cli`. Transport tests that open `AF_UNIX` sockets
fail with `PermissionError: EPERM` in the sandboxed research environment (3 of
103 baseline tests); they are marked `xdist_group("af_unix")` and must be run in
an environment that permits sockets — a skip there is recorded, not reported as
pass, and is not a product defect.

Addendum scenarios (SPEC-ADDENDUM §10), all on the real scheduler and event
paths with a fake dependency, fake harness and injected clock:

| Addendum scenario | Test file | Assertion |
|---|---|---|
| ≥3-level parent/child, leaf waits, unrelated tasks keep completing | new `test_taskq_nested_wait.py` | S→A→B chain in `waiting_children` / `waiting_dependency`; a fourth root reaches `done` meanwhile |
| all slots held by parents waiting on children, system still advances | `test_admission_gate.py` (extend) | parents yield the lane slot; `child_reserve` admits a child; no deadlock within N ticks |
| many sessions hit the same dependency throttle | new `test_taskq_dependency_coordinator.py` | one `DependencyCoordinator` schedule per scope; ≤ 1 retry per `retry_at` window across sessions |
| fault isolation between dependencies | `test_taskq_dependency_coordinator.py` | scope A throttled, scope B waiters admitted; host cap unchanged |
| bounded procs/FD/connections/memory while waiting | `test_taskq_nested_wait.py`, `test_mcp_gateway_pool_integ.py` (extend) | `HostBudget` residency never exceeds the ceiling; no new runtime per wait |
| gradual wake on dependency recovery | `test_taskq_dependency_coordinator.py` | recovery signal wakes waiters through admission at ≤ `effective` per tick, never all at once |
| unexpected interactive command recovers at a safe boundary; real input wait is shown | new `test_tool_interactive_policy.py`, `test_session_health.py` (extend) | pager/stdin block → `waiting_input` with `WaitRecord.reason`; no auto-yes; no replay of a side-effecting command |

| closed-box tool truly wedged → bounded, partial result kept | `test_tool_interactive_policy.py` | `UNKNOWN` past budget → that call cancelled, partial output in `progress_json`, task `recovering` |
| `EVENT_COMPLETE` + `error: tool stall` not recorded as success | new `test_subagent_stop_reason_consistency.py` (wave N, lands first) | real `run.py` event path; completion with `STOP_REASON_TOOL_STALL` → `recovering`, never `done` |

| native subagent without fine-grained control: declared boundary holds | new `test_native_subagent_boundary.py` | `_kiro.dev/subagent/list_update` cards counted under the parent task; recovery boundary is the parent session; degradation declared |

**2000-task burst** is a test, not a script:
`test_taskq_admission_integration.py::test_2000_submissions_all_complete_window_never_exceeds_64`
(real admission and store, fake harness) pins that every submission completes
once and the dispatch window never exceeds 64. The two defects a wider
fake-harness run found during development (D1, D2 below) are each pinned by an
owner test; the run itself and its report do not ship.

### 11.1 Acceptance matrix -- landed tests (wave J)

Every scenario above maps to a test that exists on the branch. Owner tests carry
the behavioural proof; `test_overload_acceptance.py` is the map (one test per
scenario, docstring naming the owners, a smoke assertion through the public
API).

Properties of a controlled terminal (a real TTY via PTY, many terminals waiting without cross-talk, stdin-closed / invalid-handle errors) belong to that tool, which this change does not ship |

## 12. Delivery: one PR, four internal waves

Owner decision (2026-09-12): the whole design ships as **one PR** on branch
`fix/gatewayd-overload-liveness` (base `origin/main` `6f056722b`). The four work
packages below are internal waves, not separate PRs: they order the work,
partition files between implementers, and bound what each handoff note must
cover. Wave 1's slice 0 is already on the branch. The single-PR execution plan
(file ownership, gates, handoff notes) is `overload-resilience/PLAN.md` in the
crew workspace; this section is the design-level summary of it.

| Wave | Area | Scope | Size | Config (all `restart=True` unless noted) | Specs updated |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (slice 0, supervisor half superseded upstream) | — | The supervisor's "overload is not death" gate LANDED ON `main` as #10455's escalated probe: one further probe at `_LIVENESS_ESCALATED_TIMEOUT_SECS` (20s, a whole-round-trip bound) after the fast ping misses, answering either means alive, and the three-strike grace counts only cycles where neither answered. This branch's own answer to the same incident — a supervisor-side reader of the daemon's `is_serving` self-report (`mcp_gateway/self_report.py` + `GatewayManager._alive_but_overloaded`) — is therefore SUBTRACTED, not shipped: under fan-out the record is the strictly later and weaker signal, and it keeps vouching for a daemon whose accept path is dead. The record WRITER (`gatewayd._zombie_diagnostic`) pre-dates both and stays as a post-mortem log. Stub reconnect budget 600s stands. | small | — | mcp-gateway-daemon-lifecycle |

Wave 1 areas are file-disjoint and run in parallel; N starts immediately because
it touches only the completion region of `run.py` and a new helper in
`acp/types.py`. Wave 2 depends on A and B (D needs the store's attempt rows, E
needs `SpawnGate.set_capacity`, K and L need the store's `wait_json` column);
wave 3 depends on wave 2, and J's acceptance run includes the 14 addendum
scenarios (§11). Wave B ships the gate at fixed capacity so the branch is
never in a state where admission exists without a bound.

Migration: the store ships enabled (`agent.task_queue_enabled=true`,
live-reloadable; `false` restores today's in-memory `_queue` for one release).
Existing queued/running records are imported per §3.6 on first boot; the import
writes `meta.schema_version=1`. Downgrade leaves `tasks.db` in place and unread.

## 13. Alternatives considered and decisions

### Alternatives

- **Fixed semaphores only (GPT-6 "simpler sufficient" step 1).** A fixed
  daemon spawn semaphore plus a fixed session-start gate stops the storm and is
  wave B's skeleton, but it does not meet §二.3 (adaptive) and leaves the cap
  either too low on a big host or too high on a small one. Kept one flag away:
  `agent.adaptive_concurrency_mode="fixed"` (D2).
- **Per-PoolKey gates.** Multiply the machine-wide limit by key count; disk,
  memory and fork pressure are shared. Rejected.
- **Derive the spawn ceiling from `max_backends`.** Different resource
  (resident vs in-flight). Rejected.
- **Timeout-driven re-queue of `session/new`.** Leaves an unowned session and
  its MCP fleet alive; replaced by `StartCollector` (§4.4).
- **Feedback by rewriting `agent.max_subagents` in `config.json`.** Turns the
  user's ceiling into controller state and triggers the config watcher. Rejected;
  `apply_limits` is the actuator.
- **One store per entry point.** Preserves today's files but cannot express a
  cross-entry budget or lane; rejected in favour of §3.1 with the files kept as
  artifacts.
- **Network queue / distributed database.** Single-host product; rejected as in
  rfc-durable-run-coordinator §11.4.
- **Automatic Gateway restart as L5.** Would mask every lower layer's defects and
  reset the controller to cold start; L5 notifies instead.
- **A stack of four PRs.** Rejected by the owner: one PR, so the branch never
  carries a store without admission or admission without a controller seam.

### Decisions (owner, 2026-09-12; each reversible by the named flag)

Question text is kept as asked; the decision below it is final for this PR.

- **Q1.** Does `rfc-durable-run-coordinator`'s `runs`/`commands`/`outbox` become
  tables of `tasks.db`, or does this RFC supersede its store?
  **Decision:** this RFC supersedes that store. `runs`/`commands`/`outbox` become
  tables of `tasks.db`; the delivery outbox is `task_events(kind="deliver")`.
  `rfc-durable-run-coordinator.md` gets `superseded-by: rfc-overload-resilience`
  when this PR lands. Reversal: none by flag — a separate coordinator store would
  be a new RFC.
- **Reverting to pre-queue behaviour.** `agent.task_queue_enabled=false`,
  `agent.adaptive_concurrency=false` and `agent.adaptive_concurrency_mode="fixed"`
  are the three reversal flags (`taskq.md` § Configuration). The recovery ladder
  (§7) and the host budget (§5) have none: each replaces the code it supersedes
  rather than adding a mode beside it, so there is no earlier path to switch
  back to -- reversal: none by flag; a different design is a new RFC.
- **Q2.** Starting AIMD thresholds (§5.2) are unvalidated; what if the controller
  oscillates at the boundary?
  **Decision:** ship 4/1/8 per §5.2 as defaults behind
  `agent.adaptive_concurrency=true`. Thresholds are tuned by the in-repo
  fault-injection harness (wave J), not by external hosts. Reversal:
  `agent.adaptive_concurrency_mode="fixed"` turns both actuators into plain
  semaphores at `spawn_concurrency_initial` and `min(user_max, 4)`.
- **Q3.** Checkpoint-pause for dedicated-runtime parents depends on continuable
  sessions surviving a runtime close; what if `session/load` fidelity is not
  there for a mid-tool-call parent?
  **Decision:** implement `child_reserve` (1 slot) now. Checkpoint-pause is not
  built: no interface, seam or flag ships for it, so a waiting dedicated-runtime
  parent keeps its resident process. Building it once fidelity is proven means
  adding the mechanism then; until then residency exhaustion by waiting parents
  is a hard admission refusal for new parents, as §6 already states for the
  degraded case.
- **Q4.** `_pending_requests.adopt(req_id)` changes `AcpRuntime`'s request
  bookkeeping; does it need ACP-spec sign-off and a harness-parity check?
  **Decision:** implement it in `AcpRuntime` with harness-parity tests for both
  the kiro-cli and Claude backends, and document it in `acp-client.md` in the
  same PR. Reversal: `agent.start_collect_timeout_secs=0` disables the collector
  (a timed-out start is then released immediately and the task goes to
  `retry_wait`), leaving `adopt` unused but present.
- **Q5.** Do cron and hook roots get lanes keyed by job id, or share one lane?
  **Decision:** cron and hook roots share one `system` lane (key `system`);
  interactive sessions are keyed by `session_key`; scheduling is weighted round
  robin with the `system` lane at weight 1. Reversal:
  `agent.lane_weights["system"]` (default 1) raises the automation share; per-job
  lanes would be a new lane-key policy, not a flag.
- **Q6.** SQLite on network home directories (`KIROCREW_HOME` on NFS/SMB): WAL is
  unsafe there — fall back or refuse?
  **Decision:** detect (statfs / mount-type heuristics via `platform_compat`),
  switch to `journal_mode=DELETE`, and emit a `kirocrew doctor` warning; never
  refuse. Reversal: `agent.task_store_journal_mode="wal"|"delete"|"auto"`
  (default `auto`) forces either mode.
- **Q7 (integration).** Four keys the §12 table first proposed have no consumer
  in the shipped code and are NOT added: `agent.wait_deadline_secs` (the wait
  bound is the per-task `deadline_at` plus `agent.dependency_wait_deadline_secs`;
  a spawn waiting for memory is bounded separately, by
  `agent.subagent_queue_max_wait_secs`, which arrived with its consumer under
  Q10),
  `agent.keep_runtime_secs` (residency during a wait is bounded by the existing
  session idle reclaim), `agent.parent_failure_policy` (a per-call
  `on_child_failure` parameter, not a global), `agent.tool_stall_retries`
  (the ladder constant `SESSION_RECOVERY_MAX_ATTEMPTS` is the ONE source for
  every stall budget). A key with no reader is a promise the config cannot keep;
  each returns as a key only with the consumer in the same change.
- **Q8 (2026-09-30).** The spawn floor `agent.spawn_min_memory_gb` defaults to
  4.0 GB, an absolute headroom figure that predates #12203 (`default=4.0` at
  `4a945956e^`); #12203 added the cold-start reserve
  `_startup_memory_reserve_gb` on top of it. What does the default have to be
  for the floor to admit work on the hardware most operators run?
  **Decision:** the default is 3.0 GB; the reserve on top of it is unchanged, so
  the bar for the first cold start of a batch is 3.5 GB and 4.0 GB for the
  second. Grounds: the floor is compared with a probe whose composition differs
  per platform. On macOS that probe is `subagent._macos_available_memory_gb`,
  reached from `check_memory_available`: `_macos_vm_reclaimable_pages` sums
  free + inactive + speculative + purgeable pages and excludes active, wired
  and compressed pages. The recorder's posture samples read the same function
  through `resource_status.probe`, so the figures below are measured through
  the probe the floor compares against; `platform_compat._macos_available_mib`
  is a tighter sum behind `host_available_mib`, which the floor does not read.
  Through that probe a 16 GB Apple silicon host in ordinary desktop use read a
  median of 4.84 GB over one day of recorder samples (n = 3010; p25 4.48, p75
  5.26, min 2.55, max 8.28; 26 % of samples below 4.5 GB and 59 % below 5.0 GB)
  while
  `sysctl kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level` read 1 (normal) and
  `sysctl kern.memorystatus_level`, the kernel's free-memory percentage, read
  49; at 4.0 the first row of a batch was admitted about three quarters of the
  day and the second less than half (#15244, #14592). 3.0 keeps the floor a full 1 GB above
  `resource_critical_gb` and below the `resource_pressure_gb` advisory tier, so
  the ladder reads 4.0 advisory / 3.0 floor / 2.0 critical. Measured cost on
  the same host: at a 2.5 floor two dedicated workers were admitted and the
  kernel moved from `kern.memorystatus_level` 49 with
  `kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level` 1 (normal) to `kern.memorystatus_level`
  33 to 44 with `kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level` 2 (warn) for as long as
  they ran, which is why the default stops at 3.0 rather than at the bottom of
  the 2 to 3 GB range the operator asked for. A stored 4.0 is reported through the
  superseded-defaults registry and never rewritten. Reversal:
  `agent.spawn_min_memory_gb=4.0` restores the previous bar; `0` disables the
  floor and the cold-start reserve together (unchanged). Not decided here: a
  platform-aware floor (scaling to total RAM, or gating on the kernel's
  pressure level on macOS) stays open under #15244. **Partly decided by Q10
  (2026-10-01):** the macOS pressure-level gate. **Superseded by Q9:** the
  3.0 default never shipped (the code stayed at 4.0), and on 2026-10-01 the
  owner set a different direction: the only capacity guarantee is that at least
  2 GB stays free, with no count cap holding work back, and a stored 4.0 is
  adopted rather than kept.
- **Q9 (2026-10-01, accepted).** Q8's 3.0 GB default was recorded but never
  shipped, and the floor charged every start one flat `subagent_cost_gb`
  whether or not it launched a process: too much for a start that shares its
  parent's runtime, and too little for what a dedicated runtime settles at.
  What default, and what start price, let the floor admit work on a 16 GB host
  while never admitting a start that would leave the host below it?
  **Decision (owner direction, 2026-10-01):** the floor is the memory that must
  remain available AFTER a start, and its default is 2.0 GB. That is the one
  capacity guarantee; when it does not hold, the spawn waits in the queue, for
  at most `agent.subagent_queue_max_wait_secs` (Q10). A
  capacity verdict never refuses a spawn that has a queue to wait in (an
  in-memory legacy spawn that has none still refuses until it gains one);
  governance, cwd and memory-identity refusals stay refusals. Each start is
  priced by how it will run and carries that price in full until it settles:
  - Dedicated: the larger of `subagent_cost_gb` and what such a runtime settles
    at, which is its agent's learned settled size once three runs have
    measured it (bounded), else a measured default of 1.0 GB.
  - Shared: that less the kiro-cli process it does not launch (0.35 GB),
    decided by the same rule the run uses to choose its arm.
  - A shared start that turns dedicated is re-priced and re-checked against
    the floor before its process starts.

  Bars at defaults with nothing learned: a shared start 2.65 GB, the first
  dedicated start 3.0 GB, the second while the first warms 4.0 GB. Grounds: a
  `kiro-cli acp` 2.26.1 process driven with this repo's own `initialize` /
  `session/new` shape starts a fresh copy of every MCP server the agent declares
  for each session, shared or not. An extra session cost about 0.01 GB of
  process-tree USS with no servers and 0.45 to 0.6 GB with the default agent's
  roster; a dedicated start cost that plus 0.2 to 0.35 GB for its own process,
  about 0.96 GB in all. So the cost of a start is mostly its MCP roster, and a
  0.5 GB flat price under-reserved every start. **Stored values:** unlike Q8, a
  stored 4.0 is adopted to 2.0 once through the superseded-defaults registry
  (`auto_adopt`). A materialized 4.0 holds subagents in the queue on a 16 GB
  laptop, the same not-survivable class as the agent timeout budgets, and no
  suite pins a stored 4.0 as a supported configuration. Adoption is one-shot; a
  value set back afterwards is kept; a stored 3.0 or 0 is untouched.
  **Residual:** the prices are projections, from the measured defaults until an
  agent has learned its settled size; a lighter agent is over-priced until it
  learns, and an install that only runs shared starts never learns. At defaults
  the floor equals `resource_critical_gb` (2.0), so a host filled to the floor
  reads posture `critical` at the line until posture stops gating spawns.
  Reversal: `agent.spawn_min_memory_gb=4.0` (or 3.0) restores a higher bar; `0`
  disables the floor and the reserve together (unchanged). Not decided here: the
  macOS kernel-pressure veto (Q8 measured `kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level`
  2 with two dedicated workers at a 2.5 floor), which lands separately under
  #15244. **Decided by Q10 (2026-10-01).**
- **Q10 (2026-10-01, accepted).** Q8 and Q9 left the macOS kernel-pressure
  veto open under #15244. The floor's macOS figure, the reclaimable-page sum,
  does not see compressor pressure, so starts that clear the floor can still
  drive a 16 GB Mac into WARN (Q8's two dedicated workers at a 2.5 floor).
  Does the kernel's pressure level gate a start, and as what?
  **Decision (owner direction, 2026-10-01):** on macOS,
  `kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level` at WARN or above vetoes a subagent
  start. The veto is part of the 2.0 GB floor rule (Q9), not a second rule:
  the floor's macOS reading takes the level as a second input, read through a
  `platform_compat` helper. A vetoed start waits in the queue, and that wait
  is finite under the owner's same-day max-wait direction, which covers every
  start queued for memory, a vetoed one included: default 1800 s, set by the
  live-reloadable key `agent.subagent_queue_max_wait_secs` (no restart mark);
  on expiry the start gets a delivered terminal "never started: waiting for
  memory" and leaves its parent's queued count. Q7, Q9's floor rule, §8's
  queue-wait row, §14.1 W1 and §14.9 say so. The clock counts the time the
  row spends parked by its deferrals, and a re-check does not restart it; a
  row whose deferral lapsed and that now waits only for a slot is not bounded
  by it, and that slot wait does not count when it is parked again. Reversal:
  `agent.subagent_queue_max_wait_secs=0` waits without a bound. Grounds: the
  level is the kernel's own verdict and it lags, so it is a backstop beside
  the figure, not a replacement for it.
  **Implementation:** [#15876](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/pull/15876),
  whose spec calls the veto the *kernel memory-pressure hold*
  ([subagent.md § Memory guard](../system-specs/modules/subagent.md#memory-guard-what-must-remain-after-the-start)).
  Its design choices, which are not owner direction and shape where the veto
  applies (the spec holds the full set):
  - Nested children are exempt. A child's parent is a live runtime that may
    be waiting on it, so holding the child could hold the parent on an
    episode only the child can end.
  - The veto applies only while a dedicated subagent runtime of this gateway
    is running or warming. With none, foreign pressure alone never delays a
    start.
  - A vetoed start waits as a capacity-style in-memory wait (reason
    `memory_pressure`), not a store deferral, and no speculative pre-warm is
    admitted while the hold applies.

  #15876 landed bounding the hold with its own fixed constant, before the
  key existed. The key arrived with the store deferrals' bound (#16347),
  which points the hold's bound at it too, so a reload moves both and `0`
  lifts both. Reversal:
  `agent.spawn_min_memory_gb=0` disables the floor, the reserve and the veto
  together.

## 14. Waits, yielding and nested recovery (owner addendum, 2026-09-12 15:12)

The scheduler treats every pause as a **wait with a reason**; GitHub throttling,
a database outage, a pager, a permission prompt and a child fleet are adapters
over one mechanism. Nothing here forks the §3.3 machine: it adds
`waiting_dependency` and `waiting_input`, gives every wait a `WaitRecord`, and
defines who releases what.

### 14.1 `WaitRecord` and the wait-kind table

```text
WaitRecord {
  reason: str                      # adapter-specific, human-readable
  kind: W1..W7 (below)
  since: float
  resume_condition: {kind: at_time|signal|children|input|permission, at: float?, scope: str?, ids: [..]?}
  dependency_scope: str?           # e.g. "github:api.github.com:core", "provider:<id>"
  cancel_semantics: cancel_call|cancel_task|cancel_tree
  evidence_source: execution_layer|liveness_oracle|dependency_adapter|model_text  # model_text is never trusted alone
  checkpoint_ref: str?
}
```

Stored on the task row (`wait_json`) and appended to `task_events(kind="wait")`
on entry and `kind="wake"` on exit. "Quota" below means the logical lane slot
(`ExecutionCap`); "real resources" means `HostBudget` residency (procs, RSS,
fds) that stays charged until the runtime is actually reclaimed — a counter is
never decremented for a process that still exists (SPEC-ADDENDUM §2).

| Kind | Wait | Who detects it | Where state is stored | Quotas released | Real resources still charged | Wake event | Termination on recovery failure |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| W1 | `queued` (capacity) | scheduler at accept | task row `state=queued` | none held | none | admission grants slot + budget | caller `deadline_at` → `failed{reason=deadline}`; a memory deferral past `agent.subagent_queue_max_wait_secs` → `failed` "never started: waiting for memory", delivered (Q10); store write failure → refused at accept |
| W2 | `waiting_dependency` (unavailable, 429, backoff) | dependency adapter emitting `DependencySignal` (§14.4); liveness oracle only corroborates | `WaitRecord{kind=at_time or signal, dependency_scope}` + `DependencyCoordinator` schedule (in-memory, rebuilt from rows on boot) | lane slot | runtime residency while the wait is short (the existing session idle reclaim bounds it); beyond that the runtime is idle-reclaimed and only the row remains | coordinator fires `retry_at` or a recovery signal for the scope; re-admission through §4.5 | attempts ≥ `dependency_max_attempts` or wait > `agent.dependency_wait_deadline_secs` (or the task's own `deadline_at`) → `failed{reason=dependency}`; `auth_failed`/`permanent_param_error` → `failed` immediately |
| W3 | `waiting_children` | parent's blocking `spawn_sub_agents` / workflow barrier, via the execution layer (tool call id), never model text | `WaitRecord{kind=children, ids=[...]}`; children rows carry `parent_id` | lane slot | parent runtime residency (shared-runtime: a session handle; dedicated: full process) for the whole wait (checkpoint-pause, §6, is designed but not built -- Q3) | last awaited child reaches terminal; parent re-admitted through §4.5 | per-call `on_child_failure` (§14.3): `fail_fast` → parent `failed` when a child fails; `collect` → parent wakes with partial set; children cancelled on parent cancel |
| W4 | `waiting_input` (interactive command, business choice, password) | tool layer: interactive-command classifier (§14.6) or oracle `STUCK_INPUT` (Linux only, §14.9) | `WaitRecord{kind=input}` + the pending tool call id | lane slot | runtime residency (the blocked process is kept; nothing is auto-answered) | user input via dashboard/channel, routed to the tool call; or user cancels that call | `agent.interactive_command_policy="cancel"` cancels the call at the no-progress budget; default `wait` holds until the user acts or `deadline_at` |
| W5 | `waiting_permission` | approval broker (existing) | `WaitRecord{kind=permission}` + approval id | lane slot (v2 of this RFC held it; v3 releases it) | runtime residency | approval decision | rejection → the tool call fails, task continues; `deadline_at` → `failed{reason=deadline}` |
| W6 | `retry_wait` (transient infra failure) | recovery ladder (§7) | `WaitRecord{kind=at_time}` + `attempts`, `next_run_at` | lane slot and budget (runtime released) | none | `next_run_at` reached; re-admission | ladder caps → `failed`; side-effect class `unknown` → `unknown_side_effect` |
| W7 | `recovering` | ladder layer L1–L4 | `WaitRecord{kind=signal, scope=layer}` | none (slot kept so the rebuild is not starved) | runtime residency being rebuilt | layer reports rebuilt; `StartCollector` settles | layer attempts exhausted → escalate or `failed` |

An unclassifiable pause is `UNKNOWN` inside `running` (the oracle's verdict), not
a wait: it keeps its slot, keeps collecting evidence, and is bounded by the
no-progress budget (§8).

### 14.2 Yielding: identity, quota and real resources are three things

On every W2–W6 entry the scheduler: (1) writes the `WaitRecord` and does not
bump `generation`; (2) releases the lane slot so §6's scheduler can admit
another task; (3) leaves the `HostBudget` charge until `runtime_reclaim` runs
(idle reclaim for shared handles, checkpoint-pause for dedicated runtimes, or
nothing for a blocked interactive process). A task that yielded keeps ownership
of any tool call it has issued: the call's `tool_call_id` stays bound to the
task's generation, so a second worker can never start the same operation
(§9.3). Harness capability picks the yield form: shared-runtime session → light
wait; dedicated runtime with a continuable session → checkpoint-pause; anything
whose state cannot be serialized (a bash process, a Python stack, an in-flight
remote operation) → light wait only, never a rebuild that would re-run it.

### 14.3 Nested propagation S → A → B

B enters W2; A, if it has no other runnable work, enters W3 with `ids=[B]`; S
likewise. Each level releases its lane slot, so the chain holds zero execution
slots and only residency. Siblings of B without a dependency on it keep
running. When B completes, A is woken and **re-admitted through §4.5** (slot,
budget, gates), then S; a wake never bypasses admission, so a dependency
recovering for 500 waiting trees produces 500 rows eligible for admission, not
500 simultaneous runtimes. Rules, per direction:

| Event | Downward (parent → children) | Upward (child → parent) |
|---|---|---|
| failure | none | `on_child_failure` (per call, no config key): `fail_fast` (default) marks the parent `failed{reason=child}` and cancels remaining children; `collect` wakes the parent with the failed set in its result |
| cancel | `cancel_tree`: children cancelled first (existing `cancel_for_parent_impl` ordering), then the parent | a cancelled child is a failed child for the policy above |
| result | — | delivered once per child id via `settle_queued_delivery`; completed siblings stay `done` |
| restart | reconcile-first (§9.7) rebuilds `parent_id` links and `WaitRecord.ids`; a parent whose children are all terminal is woken immediately | a child whose parent row is terminal is cancelled at boot |
| wait timeout | parent `deadline_at` cancels the tree | child `deadline_at` → child `failed{deadline}` → policy above |

### 14.4 Dependency signals and the coordinator

Adapters (the GitHub client in `mcp_tools`, HTTP tool wrappers, provider errors
on the ACP stream) translate service errors into one shape:

```text
DependencySignal {kind: dependency_unavailable|rate_limited|auth_failed|permanent_param_error,
                  retry_at: float?, retryable: bool, dependency_scope: str, source: str}
```

`DependencyCoordinator` (per `dependency_scope`, in `taskq/dependency.py`) owns
the single retry schedule for that scope: it honours an explicit `retry_at`,
otherwise retries on the recovery ladder's own schedule (§7: capped
exponential backoff with equal jitter, `agent.recovery_backoff_*`; a dependency
wait has no separate backoff or cap), and wakes waiters **by
capacity** (`agent.dependency_wake_per_tick`, default the current `effective`
cap) through admission. No session, subagent or nested task runs its own retry
loop for a shared scope; the ladder (§7) and the controller (§5) consult the
coordinator so infra, harness, tool and model retries do not multiply. A scope
outage only affects that scope's lane share; host-wide pressure (§5) is the only
thing that lowers the global cap. `auth_failed` and `permanent_param_error` are
terminal for the task, never a wait.

### 14.5 Structured status protocol

Existing signals reused as-is: ACP `session/update` (`METHOD_SESSION_UPDATE` in
`acp/types.py`) carries tool-call start/complete and agent text;
`_kiro.dev/metadata` carries the harness `stopReason`; kiro-cli's
`_kiro.dev/subagent/list_update` (`METHOD_SUBAGENT_LIST_UPDATE`) carries native
sub-agent identity and status; MCP `notifications/progress` with
`params._meta.progressToken` is already routed per request by
`mcp_gateway/backend.py`. None of them carries a wait reason or a resume
condition, so one extension is added:

```text
notification "kirocrew/status" (version 1) params:
  task_id, session_key, parent_id, tool_call_id, generation,
  phase: starting|running|waiting|recovering,
  wait: WaitRecord?,                       # present iff phase == waiting
  progress: {ts, source: tool_output|stream_event|checkpoint, summary},
  capabilities: {cancellable, resumable, safe_retry},
  checkpoint_ref?, result_ref?
```

Carried on ACP as a `session/update` extension frame and on MCP as a
`notifications/progress` sibling under `_meta.kirocrew_status`. Origin
validation: the runtime accepts a `kirocrew/status` frame only from the
execution layer of the session it names (the ACP connection or the gatewayd
backend bound to that `tool_call_id`); a frame arriving as model text, or naming
a `generation` other than the task's current one, is logged as
`status_rejected` and ignored. Unknown `version` → ignored with one warning; an
old harness that never sends the frame degrades to today's evidence
(transport heartbeat, process liveness, stream events), which the oracle already
separates from business progress.

### 14.6 Interactive-command policy

The tool layer classifies a command **before** execution: known pagers
(`less`, `git log` without `-P`, `man`), missing stdin with a prompt-shaped
program (`sudo`, `ssh` without `-o BatchMode`, package-manager confirms) and
declared `interactive=true` tool schemas run with `PAGER=cat`, `GIT_PAGER=cat`,
stdin closed and non-interactive flags where the mapping is known and safe; the
mapping is a table, not a rewrite of arbitrary flags. A call that still blocks is
classified by evidence (`STUCK_INPUT` from the oracle on Linux; tool-layer
prompt detection elsewhere): the scheduler first inspects existing output and
side effects, then either (a) cancels that one call and lets the model continue
with the partial output (`agent.interactive_command_policy="cancel"`), or (b)
enters W4 and waits for real input (default `"wait"`). Never auto-answer `yes`;
never re-run a command whose side effects may have happened (class `unknown`,
§9.6); a non-interactive retry stays inside the already-granted approval scope
and the original parameters. This change ships only that classifier -- it
yields the lane slot into `waiting_input` -- while the PTY-driving controlled
terminal (Kiro Crew as the child's parent, answering the prompt over stdin)
ships in a follow-up PR.

### 14.7 Stop-reason → state classifier

Verified on main: `subagent_manager/run.py` breaks out of the stream on
`EVENT_COMPLETE` (`_complete_event = event`, L1697–1699) and the only later
reader of that event is the token-usage record (L1762); no branch compares
`event.stop_reason`, so a completion carrying `STOP_REASON_TOOL_STALL`
(`"error: tool stall"`, `acp/types.py` L297) or `STOP_REASON_COMPACTION_FAILED`
(L305) is recorded with `info.result = cleaned or "_No response._"` and reaches
`_claim_finalize` as a success. `dashboard/chat_runner.py` does branch
(`event.stop_reason == STOP_REASON_TOOL_STALL` at L10831, L11030, L11120) and
runs its own continuation bounded by `slot._tool_stall_retries`. The reaper's
`stalled` flag (`monitoring.py` L629–717) is UI-only and releases nothing.
Wave N ships the regression test first, then one classifier used by every entry:

| `stop_reason` (`acp/types.py`) | Meaning | Task state | Slot | Retry |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `end_turn` | normal completion | `done` | released | — |
| `end_turn` with `partial=true` from the tool layer (`still_running` children, truncated result) | partial result | `done{partial=true}`; children keep running | released | — |
| `error: tool stall` | watchdog judged an in-flight tool dead/stuck/UNKNOWN past budget and cancelled the session | `recovering` (W7), bounded by `SESSION_RECOVERY_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (`recovery/ladder.py`; the same constant the main chat's stall recovery uses); then `failed{reason=tool_stall}` | kept during recovery | continue-nudge on existing results, never a verbatim re-run |
| `stale_recover` | wedged turn confirmed via the `session/cancel` probe | `recovering` (W7); reset + resume + continue | kept | 1, then `failed` |
| `cancelled` | user or parent cancel | `cancelled` | released | never |
| `error: compaction failed` | backend abandoned the turn after a failed compaction | `failed{reason=compaction}` (no retry, matches existing chat_runner behaviour) | released | never |
| `refusal` | model declined | `failed{reason=refusal}` | released | never (deterministic) |
| dependency error surfaced by an adapter during the turn | `DependencySignal` | `waiting_dependency` (W2) or `retry_wait` (W6) | released | coordinator schedule |
| any other `error:*` | generic infra error | `retry_wait` (W6) via ladder L1–L3 | released | ladder caps |

`classify_stop_reason(event) -> (state, retryable, reason)` lives in
`acp/types.py`; `run.py`, `chat_runner.py`, workflow agents and TaskRunner call
it instead of reading `stop_reason` ad hoc. Recovery continues from the stored
result and checkpoint, never by re-submitting the original task text.

### 14.8 Subtasks managed by Kiro Crew vs harness-native subtasks

| Backend | Native subtask surface | Identity | Tool events | Cancel | Resume | Scheduler treatment |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| kiro-cli (`ACP_BACKEND_KIRO`) `use_subagent` | `_kiro.dev/subagent/list_update` (per-sub-agent `sessionId`, status); stream events carry `AcpEvent.sub_session_id` (`acp/types.py` L599) | yes (session id) | attributable only via `sub_session_id`; approvals surface on the parent (`run.py` L1296 counts them separately) | only the parent session (`session/cancel` on the parent) | none independent of the parent | **not** a task row; counted as residency under the parent task; recovery boundary = parent session; the parent's `WaitRecord` lists native child ids for display only |
| Claude backend (`ACP_BACKEND_CLAUDE`) | in-harness task tool; no per-child ACP identity today | no | no | parent only | none | same boundary as above; declared in `harness-parity.md` as a capability gap, not a defect |
| `spawn_run` / `spawn_sub_agents` (all backends) | Kiro Crew task rows | yes | yes | per task | per task (continuable) | full scheduling (§3–§9) |

A backend that later exposes per-child cancel/resume is integrated by adding a
row adapter; until then the UI showing native cards never implies the scheduler
can pause or restart one. Shared-runtime recovery (L3) rebuilds only the affected
session handle, never the runtime shared with unrelated sessions.

### 14.9 Budgets and platform evidence

Wait budgets are separate from the execution budget (§8): time in W1–W6 does
not count toward `subagent_timeout_secs`; each wait kind has its own bound
(`deadline_at`, `subagent_queue_max_wait_secs` for a W1 row deferred for memory,
`dependency_wait_deadline_secs`, coordinator caps, ladder caps). A blocking
`spawn_sub_agents` expiry returns `still_running` with ids and states (§8) and
never marks the child failed.

| Evidence | Linux | macOS | Windows | Declared degradation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| process tree | `/proc/<pid>/task/*/children` (`iter_descendants`) | `libproc` backend (`LibprocBackend`) | none in the oracle today | Windows: tree unknown → `UNKNOWN`, bounded by the no-progress budget; wave M documents it in `acp/liveness.py` |
| blocked on stdin (`STUCK_INPUT`) | `wchan` in `n_tty_read` / `pipe_read` / `wait_woken` | absent by design (`liveness.py` module docstring) | absent | W4 on macOS/Windows relies on the tool-layer classifier (§14.6); a matched shell that is alive is `WORKING`, so the no-progress budget is the only bound — "alive" is never "forever" |
| CPU progress | `/proc/<pid>/stat` ticks | libproc CPU time | none | flat → `UNKNOWN`, never `DEAD` |
| socket / LLM wait | `/proc/net` established-flat | absent | absent | a flat model wait is `UNKNOWN`, never `DEAD` |
| business progress | stream events, `kirocrew/status` progress | same | same | platform-independent; outranks all of the above |

Every degradation above is a declared row in the wave M spec update, a
`kirocrew doctor` line, and a `liveness_evidence{platform,kind}` metric — not a
silent `UNKNOWN`.
