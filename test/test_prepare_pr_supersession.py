"""Regression tests for same-head verdict supersession detection.

A review lane's marker comment is one slot keyed on the lane marker alone, so a
second sample at one head replaces the first and the board keeps only the
survivor. The replaced body survives in GraphQL ``userContentEdits``. These tests
pin that the reader tells a same-head supersession from an ordinary stale-head
replacement, and that the one direction which can manufacture a pass -- a
blocking sample replaced by a clean one at the SAME head -- is named.

The harmful direction has ONE observed instance in the repository's own history
(559 bot comments across 60 pull requests, 26 `(lane, head)` pairs holding two or
more samples for a single head, one of them a block replaced by a non-blocking
body). One real transition cannot exercise the ways the reading goes wrong, so the
rest is constructed here. A detector whose load-bearing branch is exercised only by
data that barely exists is a detector nobody has tested.
