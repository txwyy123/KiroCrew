"""The subagent DEPENDENCY park's ``running`` mark against a row still ``admitted``.

The dependency path does not reach ``ensure_running_marked``: its wait write is
inline, so its mark travels into the same database phase
(``RunEventCoordinator._dependency_report_db``). That made it the one mark that
did NOT get the missed-``starting`` replay, and a lost start write there produced
three consecutive ``rejected_transition`` events -- the ``running`` mark, then the
wait, then the coordinator's ``retry_wait`` park -- leaving a LIVE run parked on a
dependency backoff behind a row the next boot requeues blind.

The mark is also UNCONDITIONAL, which is the second half: the in-memory
``_taskq_running_marked`` flag is published ahead of a POSTED write whose boolean
is discarded, so any durable decision that reads the flag can be wrong in exactly
the direction that loses the run's result. Those pins drive the real
``_dependency_verdict`` with the production off-loop hand-off.

Fake clock, a real SQLite store in ``tmp_path``. No kiro-cli: the subjects are one
static database phase, the coroutine that hands work to it, and the store under
both.
