#: dev Linux box drains the whole set in ~18 s, the same box with its core
#: contended took ~4.4 minutes, and the rate a Windows shard measured (648 rows in
#: 60 s) puts the set near 3 minutes there. Sized well above the slowest of those
#: because a host slower still is a slow host, not a broken queue -- a queue that
#: has genuinely stopped is caught sooner and far more cheaply by
#: :data:`_STALLED_PASSES`. Deliberately BELOW the per-test timeout the drain
#: test's marker raises, with room to spare for the submission phase this does NOT
#: wrap, so reaching it fails as an assertion naming the state counts rather than
#: as a killed xdist worker -- on Windows pytest-timeout has no SIGALRM and takes
#: the whole worker with it.

    time is the host's per-row cost: ~18 s of drain on an idle dev Linux box, ~4.4
    minutes on the same box with its core contended.

    Two independent bounds, and which one fires names the failure. A queue that has
    stopped moving returns after :data:`_STALLED_PASSES` idle passes, and the
    state-count assertion below reports what was left -- that is the fast signal,
    and it is the one a real defect trips. Only a host still making progress
    reaches :data:`_DRAIN_CEILING_SECS`, which raises those same counts as an
    assertion rather than a bare ``TimeoutError``.

    So the ceiling is a backstop on WALL TIME, not a poll count raised until a
    race stops firing: it wraps no assertion, so no value of it can make a wrong
    answer pass -- it can only stop a slow-but-correct host from being reported as
    a broken queue. The marker sits above the ceiling plus the submission phase,
    which the ceiling does not wrap, so on a slow host the ceiling is what fires;
    the Windows shard's ``--timeout=180`` would otherwise kill the worker, and
    with ``--max-worker-restart=0`` that is a lost run, not a named failure.

    ``WaitLedger.on_child_terminal`` adds the reported child to the terminal set

    from a reporter the fence rejected tells the parent its last awaited child
    ended. Both halves are load-bearing and they pull opposite ways, which is
    why the predicate is the row's LIVENESS and not its generation:

    * ``a_live_replacement`` -- the row runs under a newer generation. A
      replacement owns the outcome and holds a ``_claim_finalize`` token of its
      own, so propagating here wakes the parent while its child is still
      running. It must stay parked.
    * ``a_terminal_owner`` -- the generation moved AND the row ended, the shape
      of an operator cancel through ``/api/tasks`` (``store.cancel`` bumps the
      generation). Nobody will report it again and ``WaitLedger.rebuild`` only
      reconciles at boot, so a guard written as "my generation is stale" would
      park this parent until the next restart. It must be woken.

    Both settle paths, because each reads the row in a frame of its own: the
    inline write, and the one posted to the writer thread (production's).
