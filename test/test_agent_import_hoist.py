"""Module-scope ``kiro_crew.agent`` imports stay at module scope.

The four modules below import ``from kiro_crew.agent import ...`` at module
scope. ``kiro_crew.agent`` imports nothing from ``kiro_crew.dashboard.*`` or
``kiro_crew.session``, so no import cycle exists; these tests keep the imports
at module scope and prove no cycle exists in either load order.

Order-dependent cycles only surface in a fresh interpreter, not under a
bare import in an already-warm test process — hence the subprocess runs.
