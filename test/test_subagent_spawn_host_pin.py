"""A NEW test that spawns a subagent must not read the host's free memory.

``SubagentManager.spawn`` queues -- returning before it registers anything in
``_tasks`` -- while the machine looks short of memory: the absolute floor
(``check_memory_available`` against ``agent.spawn_min_memory_gb``).
``test/conftest.py``'s ``healthy_host_memory`` pins that reading, but only for a
file that asks for it -- so this is what stops the pinned set falling behind
``test/``.

A ratchet rather than a convention, because of how the failure reads: a queued
spawn IS a ``SubagentInfo``, so ``assert info is not None`` still passes and the test dies on the NEXT line with
a bare ``KeyError`` naming an id nothing else mentions. Nothing in the traceback
says "memory"; the only evidence is a WARNING in the captured log. Measured on a
CI runner with ~0.5 GB free, on a PR that touched none of this.

Deliberately WIDER than the fixture acts on, the same way
``test_host_isolation_floor.py``'s ratchet is: a module that names
``SubagentManager`` AND calls ``.spawn(`` must be either pinned or excluded with
a reason, so adding one forces a decision instead of an omission. Files whose
``spawn`` is ``AcpRuntime.spawn`` never name ``SubagentManager`` and so are not
swept up -- that method has no memory gate.

A second ratchet below covers the other half: being pinned is not enough if the
test throws the pin away mid-body with a bare ``monkeypatch.undo()``, which
reverts the fixture's patches too because pytest hands the test and the fixture
the same ``monkeypatch`` instance.
