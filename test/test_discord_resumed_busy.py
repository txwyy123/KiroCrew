"""A Discord message into a BUSY resumed dashboard session reaches that slot's own
mid-turn machinery instead of a refusal.

A DM bound to a dashboard session (``!sessions`` or the dashboard mirror menu)
cannot use the Discord-side mid-turn machinery while the dashboard is driving:
the Discord queue drains only at the tail of a Discord-driven turn and its replay
skips resume routing, so a message queued there would run in the NATIVE session.
The dashboard slot has its own steer path and its own queue, drained by the
dashboard turn loop; these tests pin that the resumed branch hands the message to
THOSE, records the same audience fence the peer-steer path records, confirms in
the channel, and keeps the refusal for the cases the slot cannot take.

The dashboard state is the real ``DashboardState`` with a real slot, because the
hand-off writes the slot's queue, its pending-steer bookkeeping and its audience
fences -- a hand-rolled fake would let the routing decision pass against a slot
shape production never has.
