"""Reclaiming the crew log of a member the roster does not hold.

The authorization is the roster and nothing else: a member's unit is keyed by its
slug, so the only safe question is whether a live member still derives that key.
Neither an age nor a size takes part, which is what makes the refusals the weight
of this file -- keeping a deleted member's log costs disk, while removing a LIVE
member's log destroys a history nothing can rebuild.

So the two directions are pinned side by side: a delete collects the unit, and no
shape of this path touches a unit the roster still claims -- a surviving
namesake, a sibling member, a crew whose name the roster grammar rejects, or a
config that cannot be read at all.
