"""Shared fakes for the overload-resilience tests (taskq, admission, fairness, adaptive).

A plain module, imported explicitly (``from overload_fakes import Clock``) like
``terminal_fakes``: no autouse magic, every test file names what it takes.

* :class:`Clock` -- a callable virtual clock (``clock()`` returns ``t``); the
  starting instant is a constructor argument so each suite keeps its own epoch.
* :class:`FixedRng` -- every draw answers the top of its range so jittered instants are exact.
* :func:`backoff` -- the coordinator's recovery-ladder schedule with a test-sized base and cap.
* :func:`task_record` -- a minimal ``TaskRecord`` for one id.
* :func:`open_task_store` -- the store a fixture yields, closed on teardown.
* :func:`settle_store_writes` / :func:`settle_dependency_park` -- the two
  barriers: the store's writer thread, and a step reaching its dependency wait.
* :func:`settle_depth_emits` -- wait out every in-flight queued-depth emit.
* :func:`memory_critical` -- the posture gate's low-memory verdict, for deferring a spawn.
* :class:`ManagerHarness` -- a real ``SubagentManager`` whose runs finish when
  the test says so, with the mocks it needs (:func:`mock_sessions`, :func:`mock_ctx`).
