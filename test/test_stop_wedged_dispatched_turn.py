"""Dashboard Stop against a turn whose provider reports no active turn.

A turn wedged inside a dispatched, mid-execution tool call that never acks a
cooperative cancel reaches ``stop_turn`` as a non-acked outcome, which that
method escalates to a hard reset itself. The separate ``"idle"`` outcome means
the provider holds no active turn to cancel: the model stream reached its done
boundary, or no session is registered for the key. When the slot still reads
running at that point the turn ended at the provider but the slot has not seen
the terminal event settle it.

The handler resolves the orphaned card and names the honest state for that
case: ``{"ok": True, "info": "no active turn"}`` rather than a bare
``{"ok": True}`` that reads as "stopped a running turn". It does NOT force a
hard reset -- there is no live provider turn to kill, so a reset would
cold-restart a healthy backend that is merely finishing its post-stream tail.
